ORDER

The Petitioner’s Request for Review of the Regional Director’s administrative dismissal 
of the instant petitions raises no substantial issues warranting reversal of the Regional Director’s 
action.  Accordingly, the dismissal is affirmed.1

1 Consistent with his concurring view expressed in FJC Security Services, 360 NLRB No. 115, 
slip op. at 1-4 (2014) (Member Miscimarra, concurring), Member Miscimarra would adhere to 
the standard established in MV Transportation, 337 NLRB 770, 770 (2002), where the Board 
held that “an incumbent union in a successorship situation is entitled to—and only to—a 
rebuttable presumption of continuing majority status, which will not serve as a bar” to an 
otherwise valid rival union petition; and alternatively, Member Miscimarra believes that a 
successor bar under UGL-UNICCO Service Co., 357 NLRB No. 76 (2011), if applied, should 
commence running when the successor is first required to recognize and bargain with the union 
rather than when the parties have their first bargaining session.  Accordingly, Member 
Miscimarra would grant review and find that the petitions warrant an election.
