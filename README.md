Liberate data from NLRB pdf files

About
-----
This project will be an attempt to liberate data from [National Labor Relations Board](http://www.nlrb.gov/rss) PDF documents. The NLRB currently regularly releases various decisions and briefs that are in PDF files. This is not ideal. This project will start by going feed by feed and converting PDFs to Markdown. It may grow further from there. The inspiration for this project is [PDF Liberation](https://github.com/pdfliberation/).

This project is going to be developed slowly because who has time?
