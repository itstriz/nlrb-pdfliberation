M & B ASPHALT CO., INC.

and

INTERNATIONAL UNION OF 
OPERATING ENGINEERS, LOCAL NO. 18

Petitioner 

Case 08-RC-127048

DECISION AND CERTIFICATION OF REPRESENTATIVE

The National Labor Relations Board, by a three-member panel, has considered an

objection to an election held May 30, 2014, and the hearing officer’s report recommending 

disposition of it. The election was conducted pursuant to a Stipulated Election Agreement. The 

tally of ballots shows 10 for and 8 against the Petitioner, with no challenged ballots.

The Board has reviewed the record in light of the exceptions and briefs,1 has adopted the 

hearing officer’s findings and recommendations,2 and finds that a certification of representative 

should be issued.

established policy is not to overrule a hearing officer’s credibility resolutions unless the clear 
preponderance of all the relevant evidence convinces us that they are incorrect. Stretch-Tex Co., 
118 NLRB 1359, 1361 (1957). We have carefully examined the record and find no basis for 
reversing the findings.  Member Johnson agrees with the Employer that the record demonstrates 
that the meetings took place on company time, and that there is precedent supporting that 
meetings with as few as three employees can trigger the Peerless Plywood rule, but even such 
precedent requires an assembly of employees.  See, e.g.,  Shirks Motor Express Corp., 113 
NLRB 753, 755 (1955) ( “As the Employer permitted Local 107 to talk to the assembled night 
shift employees on company time and property within 24 hours of the instant election, in 
violation of the Peerless Plywood rule, we, in agreement with the Regional Director's 
recommendations, sustain the Petitioner's objections.”) (emphasis added) ;  Great Atlantic & 
Pacific Tea Co., 111 NLRB 623, 624 (1955) (“On the day of the election, before the arrival of

premises…”) (emphasis added).  There is insufficient evidence that employees were assembled, 
so as to invoke the rule.  See R. Br. at 12 (noting that union representatives “made their rounds” 
among the individual employees).
2 In the absence of exceptions, we adopt pro forma the hearing officer’s recommendation to 
overrule the Employer’s Objection 1.
