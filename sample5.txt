DECISION AND ORDER

BY MEMBERS HIROZAWA, JOHNSON,

AND SCHIFFER 

On July 31, 2012, the Board issued a Decision and Or-
der and Notice and Invitation to File Briefs in this pro-
ceeding, which is reported at 358 NLRB No. 94.  There-
after,  the  Respondent  filed  a  petition  for  review  in  the 
United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  District  of  Co-
lumbia  Circuit,  and  the  General  Counsel  filed  a  cross-
application for enforcement.  

At the time of the Decision and Order and Notice and 
Invitation  to  File  Briefs,  the  composition  of  the  Board 
included  two  persons  whose  appointments  to  the  Board 
had been challenged as constitutionally infirm.  On June 
26,  2014,  the  United  States Supreme  Court  issued  its 
decision  in  NLRB  v.  Noel  Canning, 134  S.Ct.  2550 
(2014),  holding  that  the  challenged  appointments  to  the 
Board  were  not  valid.    Thereafter,  the  court  of  appeals 
vacated the Board’s Decision and Order and Notice and 
Invitation to File Briefs and remanded this case for fur-
ther  proceedings  consistent  with  the  Supreme  Court’s 
decision. 

The National Labor Relations Board has delegated its 

authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.

In view of the decision of the Supreme Court in NLRB 
v. Noel Canning, supra, we have considered de novo the 
judge’s decision and the record in light of the exceptions 
and  briefs.    We  have  also  considered  the  now-vacated 
Decision  and  Order  and  Notice  and  Invitation  to  File 
Briefs, and we agree with the rationale set forth therein.  
Accordingly, we affirm the judge’s rulings, findings, and 
conclusions  and  adopt  judge’s  recommended  Order  to 
the extent and for the reasons stated in the Decision and 
Order and Notice and Invitation to File Briefs reported at 
358 NLRB No. 94, which is incorporated herein by ref-
erence and as amended below.1
                                                

1 In its now-vacated decision, the Board invited interested parties to 
file briefs addressing whether, in connection with an award of backpay, 
the Board should routinely require a respondent to (1) submit the ap-
propriate documentation to the Social Security  Administration so that 
when backpay is paid, it is allocated to the appropriate calendar quar-
ters, and (2) reimburse a discriminatee for any excess Federal and State 

361 NLRB No. 137

ORDER

The  National  Labor  Relations  Board  orders  that  the 
Respondent,  Latino  Express,  Inc.,  Chicago,  Illinois,  its 
officers, agents, successors, and assigns, shall

1.  Cease and desist from
(a) Discharging  or  otherwise  discriminating  against 
employees  because  they  engage  in  protected  union  or 
concerted  activities,  including  supporting  the  Interna-
tional Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 777, or any other 
labor organization.

(b) Coercively interrogating employees about their un-

ion membership, activities, sympathies, or support.

(c) Prohibiting employees from discussing their terms 

and conditions of employment.

(d)  Creating  the  impression  that  it  is  engaged  in  sur-
veillance of its employees’ union or other protected con-
certed activities.

(e) Soliciting grievances from employees and promis-
ing  to  remedy  them  in  order  to  discourage  employees 
from selecting union representation.

(f) Promising improved benefits to employees in order 
to discourage employees from selecting union represen-
tation.
                                                                             
income  taxes  the  discriminatee  may  owe  in  receiving  a  lump-sum 
backpay award covering more than 1 year.  358 NLRB No. 94, slip op. 
at 2–3.  After receiving supplemental briefs, the Board answered those 
questions in the affirmative.  Latino Express, Inc., 359 NLRB No. 44 
(2012),  reaffirmed  in  Don  Chavas,  LLC  d/b/aTortillas  Don  Chavas, 
361 NLRB No. 10 (2014).  Accordingly, we shall modify the judge’s 
recommended Order to conform with Tortillas Don Chavas.  We shall 
also substitute a new notice to conform to the Order as modified and in 
accordance with Durham School Services, 360 NLRB No. 85 (2014).

In addition, we find merit in the General Counsel’s exception to the 
judge’s failure to recommend that the notice be read aloud to employ-
ees by the Respondent or a Board agent.  Specifically, we find that this 
case merits a public reading of the notice by coowner and vice presi-
dent, Henry Garduñio, or by a Board agent in the presence of Garduñio, 
to employees assembled on company time because “[t]he Respondent’s 
violations  of  the  Act  are  sufficiently  serious  and  widespread  that  the 
reading of the notice is necessary to enable employees to exercise their 
Section 7 rights free of coercion.” Carey Salt Co., 360 NLRB No. 38, 
slip op. at 2 (2014).  See, e.g., Homer D. Bronson Co., 349 NLRB 512, 
515 (2007) (notice-reading remedy ordered where respondent’s senior 
manager threatened plant closure and job loss at meetings if employees 
voted for union representation), enfd. mem. 273 Fed. Appx. 32 (2d Cir. 
2008).  Garduñio was personally involved in the unlawful discharges of 
Carol  Garcia  and  Pedro  Salgado,  and  engaged  in  a  number  of  other 
violations of the Act during the union organizing campaign by solicit-
ing  grievances  from  employees,  interrogating  an  employee  about  his 
union  support,  and  creating  an  impression  of  surveillance  of  union 
supporters.  In those circumstances, we find that a reading of the notice 
by Garduñio, or in his presence, is appropriate “to dissipate as much as 
possible any lingering effects of the Respondent’s unfair labor practic-
es,” and will allow the employees to “fully perceive that the Respond-
ent and its managers are bound by the requirements of the Act.”  Homer 
D. Bronson Co., supra (citations omitted).  If Garduñio is no longer an 
owner or officer  of the Respondent, then the Respondent shall desig-
nate another owner or officer to conduct or be present for the reading.
