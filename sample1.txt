Case 04-RC-128714

DECISION AND CERTIFICATION OF REPRESENTATIVE

The National Labor Relations Board, by a three-member panel, has 

considered objections to an election held June 26, 2014, and the Regional

Director’s report recommending disposition of them.  The election was conducted

pursuant to a Stipulated Election Agreement.  The tally of ballots shows 19 votes

cast for and 17 against the Petitioner, with no challenged ballots.

The Board has reviewed the record in light of the exceptions and briefs, has

adopted the Regional Director’s findings and recommendations, and finds that a 

certification of representative should be issued.

CERTIFICATION OF REPRESENTATIVE

IT IS CERTIFIED that a majority of the valid ballots have been cast for

Laborers Local 332, and that it is the exclusive collective-bargaining

representative of the employees in the following appropriate unit:

All full time production employees, maintenance employees and shipping 
and receiving employees employed by the Employer at its 161 Corporate 
facility; excluding all other

NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

MEMBER MISCIMARRA, concurring:

For two reasons, I find there is no merit in the Employer’s request for review and 

exceptions to the Regional Director’s report and recommendation.  First, regarding 

Objections 1, 2 and 3, the Employer assertedly received a report of alleged threats to 

certain Asian employees that, for example, if the Union won the election, and if certain

employees failed to vote for the Union, the Union would have those employees fired.  

However, the Employer refused to convey to the Region the name or names of the 

employee(s) who allegedly reported the threat.  Further, the Region was given neither 

the names of the employees to whom the threatening statement was allegedly made, 

nor the name or names of the alleged Union supporter(s) who allegedly made the 

threats.  The Act protects employees from restraint or coercion, and such misconduct 

may be objectionable conduct that is grounds for overturning an election; but the Region 

cannot conduct a meaningful investigation unless, at a minimum, it is given the names 

of potential witnesses or at least the names of individuals who can identify potential 

2

witnesses.  At least some of this information was available to the Employer, which, on 

the basis of promises of confidentiality, declined to provide that information.  While I am

sympathetic to employee fears regarding potential retaliation or threats, the Region and 

the Board cannot conduct a meaningful investigation or act upon allegations of 

misconduct without this basic information.  See, e.g., Heartland of Martinsburg, 313 

NLRB 655 (1994) (“The Employer here submitted counsel’s hearsay description of 

alleged objectionable conduct and the names of witnesses who could provide direct 

testimony about it.  This was sufficient information to warrant a full investigation of the 

issues raised in the objections.”); The Holladay Corporation, 266 NLRB 621, 622 (1983)

(“[B]y identifying two employees who allegedly received improper inducements to 

support the Petitioner, the Employer has furnished the kind of evidence necessary for 

the Region to proceed with a full investigation of the objections.”); Cities Service Oil Co., 

77 NLRB 853, 857 (1948) (“[W]e consider as crucial, in making an investigation of 

preelection interference, that we have the names of witnesses upon whom the moving 

party relies.  Absent that information, the Board is unable adequately to investigate the 

matter.”).  See also NLRB Casehandling Manual (Part Two) Representation Sec. 

11392.6.  Second, I find that Objection 4 (regarding a hand gesture by one employee 

observed by another employee outside but in the vicinity of the polling area, which the 

latter employee interpreted as “someone was trying to tell me to vote ‘yes’”) is without 

merit for the reasons articulated by the Regional Director. 

Dated, Washington, D.C., December 15, 2014.
