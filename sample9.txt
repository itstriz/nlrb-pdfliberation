ORDER DENYING MOTION

BY CHAIRMAN PEARCE AND MEMBERS MISCIMARRA,

HIROZAWA, JOHNSON, AND SCHIFFER

The  Respondent’s  motion  for  reconsideration  of  the 
Board’s Decision and Order reported at 361 NLRB No. 
57  (2014), is  denied.1    The  Respondent  argues  why  it 
disagrees  with  the  Board’s  decision,  but  has  not  identi-
fied  any  material  error  or  demonstrated  extraordinary 
circumstances  warranting  reconsideration  under  Section 
102.48(d)(1) of the Board’s Rules and Regulations.
                                                          

1 The  document  filed  by  the  Respondent  is  styled  “Exceptions  to 
Board Decision.” We construe it as a motion for reconsideration pur-
suant to Sec. 102.48 of the Board’s Rules and Regulations.  The Gen-
eral Counsel filed a brief in opposition.

The  Respondent  seeks  reconsideration  of  the  Board’s  decision  to 
overrule Planned Building Services, 347 NLRB 670 (2006).  Members 
Miscimarra and Johnson dissented from the majority’s decision in this 
regard, and they adhere to their dissent.  They agree, however, that the 
Respondent has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances warrant-
ing reconsideration.
