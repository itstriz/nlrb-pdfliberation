SUPPLEMENTAL DECISION AND ORDER

BY MEMBERS MISCIMARRA, HIROZAWA, AND SCHIFFER
On  December  24,  2013,  Administrative  Law  Judge 
Geoffrey  Carter issued  the  attached  supplemental  deci-
sion.  The Respondent filed exceptions and a supporting 
brief, and the General Counsel filed cross-exceptions and 
a  supporting  brief.    The  Respondent  and  the  General 
Counsel each filed an answering brief and a reply brief.  
The National Labor Relations Board has delegated its 

authority in this proceeding to a three-member panel.

The Board has considered the decision and the record 
in light of the exceptions and briefs and has decided to 
affirm  the  judge’s  rulings,1 findings,2 and  conclusions 
and to adopt the recommended Order.
                                                          

1 The Respondent excepts to the judge’s ruling granting certain por-
tions  of  the  General  Counsel’s  motion  for  partial  summary  judgment
and finding that some of the Respondent’s answers to the compliance 
specification and amendments were deficient under the Board’s Rules 
and Regulations.  We find it unnecessary to decide whether the judge’s 
ruling  was  correct.    Even  if  the  judge  was  mistaken,  it  was,  at most, 
harmless error: the judge also ruled on the merits of the allegations in 
the  compliance  specification  and  amendments,  and  we  are  affirming 
those findings.  

The Respondent also argues that the judge erroneously excluded ev-
idence of the discriminatee’s prior criminal convictions.  We find that 
the judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding this evidence.  

2 The General Counsel and the Respondent have excepted to some of 
the judge’s credibility findings.  The Board’s established policy is not 
to overrule an administrative law judge’s credibility resolutions unless 
the clear preponderance of all the relevant evidence convinces us that 
they are incorrect.  Standard Dry Wall Products, 91 NLRB 544 (1950), 
enfd. 188  F.2d 362  (3d Cir. 1951).   We  have  carefully  examined  the 
record and find no basis for reversing the findings.

No party asks us to revisit or overrule St. George Warehouse, 351 
NLRB  961 (2007),  but  the  General  Counsel  excepts  to  the  judge’s 
determination that the Respondent showed that substantially equivalent 
jobs  were  available  during  the  backpay  period  as  required  by  St. 
George.  We find it unnecessary to pass on this exception.  A finding 
that the Respondent failed to carry its burden would not affect the out-
come because the judge found, and we agree, that the General Counsel 
demonstrated  that  the  discriminatee  engaged  in  a  reasonable  effort  to 
find work.  

In affirming the judge’s order, we do not rely on his citations to La-
tino  Express,  359  NLRB  No.  44  (2012),  or  Life’s  Connections,  359 
NLRB  No.  85  (2013).    We  nevertheless  agree  that  the  Respondent 
should not be ordered to compensate the discriminatee for the adverse 
tax consequences of his backpay award or to file a report with the So-
cial  Security  Administration  allocating  backpay  to  the  appropriate 
quarters.    These  remedies  are  not  appropriate  because  they  were  not

SUPPLEMENTAL DECISION

STATEMENT OF THE CASE

GEOFFREY  CARTER,  Administrative  Law  Judge.  This  sup-
plemental proceeding was tried before me in Washington, D.C., 
on September 4–6, 9–10, 2013,1 pursuant to a compliance spec-
ification and notice of hearing that issued on May 31, 2013, and 
was amended on August 1, 2013. 

In  the  underlying  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ)  decision, 
Judge  Arthur  Amchan  found  (among  other  violations  not  at 
issue  here)  that  Pessoa  Construction  Company  (Respondent) 
violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the National Labor Relations 
Act (the Act) when it discharged employee William Membrino.  
Judge  Amchan  recommended  that  Respondent  be  required  to 
offer  Membrino  full  reinstatement  to  his  former  job  and  also 
make Membrino whole for any loss of earnings and other bene-
fits suffered as a result of the discrimination against him.  In a 
Decision  and  Order  dated  May  19,  2011,  the  Board  adopted 
Judge Amchan’s recommended Order, with the slight modifica-
                                                                                            
included in the Board’s Order in the unfair labor practice case, which 
has since been enforced by the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Fourth Circuit.  356 NLRB No. 157 (2011), enfd. 507 Fed. Appx. 304 
(4th  Cir.  2013).    Compare  Interstate  Bakeries  Corp.,  360  NLRB  No.

diction to modify Order enforced by court of appeals).

The  compliance  specification  at  issue  here  alleges  the 
amount of backpay due under the terms of the Board’s Decision 
and Order.  The General Counsel alleges that Respondent owes 
$107,929  in  backpay  to Membrino,  plus  interest  compounded 
daily and Respondent’s share of FICA contributions.  (GC Exh. 
1(k).)  Respondent maintains that it only owes $912 in backpay 
to Membrino.  (GC Exhs. 1(i) and 1.)

General Counsel’s Motion for Partial 

Summary Judgment

A. Background

On August 23, 2013, the General Counsel notified Respond-
ent  by  email  that  the  General  Counsel  believed  Respondent’s 
answers  to  paragraphs  4(e)  and  (g)  of  the  amendment  to  the 
compliance  specification  were  insufficient  and  not  in  compli-
ance with Section 102.56(b) and (c) of the Board’s Rules and 
Regulations.    Later  that  same  day,  the  General  Counsel  also 
notified  Respondent  that  it  believed  Respondent’s  answers  to 
paragraphs 3 and 4(h) of the compliance specification were not 
sufficiently specific to comply with the applicable Board Rules.  
The  General  Counsel  asked  Respondent  to  file  an  amended 
answer  by  August  30  that  provided  more  specificity  about  its 
assertions and calculations, and warned that if Respondent did 
not  file  an  amended  answer,  the General  Counsel  would  con-
sider  filing  a  motion  for  summary  judgment  or  a  motion  to 
strike  before  the  hearing.    Respondent’s  counsel  replied  by 
email that he was tied up for the afternoon (on August 23), but 
did not take further action to respond to the concerns that the 
General  Counsel  raised  about  Respondent’s  answers  to  the 
compliance specification.  (Motion for Partial Summary Judg-
ment, Exh. 7.)

On September 4, 2013, the first day of trial in this matter, the 
General Counsel filed a motion for partial summary judgment 
in which it asserted that Respondent’s answers to the compli-
ance specification and amendments thereto were deficient un-
der  applicable  Board  Rules  and  Regulations.    In  a  discussion 
held  off  the  record  with  all  parties,  the  General  Counsel  re-
quested that we proceed with the trial (instead of continuing the 
trial to allow Respondent the opportunity to file a brief in re-
sponse to the motion for partial summary judgment), and that I 
consider its motion when preparing my supplemental decision 
and order on the merits.  I agreed, and now turn to the General 
Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment.  In that con-
nection, I note that although Respondent filed a posttrial brief 
in this matter, it did not address the issues raised in the General 
Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment.

B. Applicable Legal Standards—Motion for Partial 

Summary Judgment

Section 102.56(b) and (c) of the Board’s Rules and Regula-
tions states as follows regarding the type of information that a 

respondent  needs  to  provide  when  submitting  an  answer  to  a 
compliance specification:

(b) Contents of answer to specification.—The answer
shall  specifically  admit,  deny,  or  explain  each and  every 
allegation  of  the  specification,  unless  the respondent  is 
without knowledge, in which case the respondent shall so 
state,  such  statement  operating  as a  denial.  Denials  shall 
fairly meet the substance of the allegations of the specifi-
cation at issue. When a respondent intends to deny only a 
part of an allegation, the respondent shall specify so much 
of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. As to all
matters within the knowledge of the respondent, including
but  not  limited  to  the  various  factors  entering into  the 
computation  of  gross  backpay,  a  general denial  shall  not 
suffice. As to such matters, if the respondent disputes ei-
ther the accuracy of the figures in the specification or the 
premises on which they are based, the answer shall specif-
ically state the basis for such disagreement, setting forth in 
detail the respondent’s position as to the applicable prem-
ises and furnishing the appropriate supporting figures.

(c) Effect of failure to answer or to plead specifically 

and in detail to backpay allegations of specification.—
. . . .  If the respondent files an answer to the specification but 
fails to deny any allegation of the specification in the manner 
required by paragraph (b) of this section, and the failure so to
deny  is  not  adequately  explained,  such  allegation shall  be 
deemed to be admitted to be true, and may be so found by the 
Board without the taking of evidence supporting such allega-
tion, and the respondent shall be precluded from introducing 
any evidence controverting the allegation.

Consistent with these rules, the Board has granted motions for 
partial summary judgment when a respondent files a deficient 
answer  (e.g.,  an  answer  that  fails  to  deny  certain  allegations 
with  the  specificity  required  by  Board  Rule  102.56(b))  to  a 
compliance  specification.    See,  e.g.,  SRC  Painting,  LLC,  356 
NLRB No. 74, slip op. at 2 (2011).

C. Analysis—Motion for Partial Summary Judgment

In its motion, the General Counsel requested that I: (a) find 
that Respondent admitted paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the compli-
ance  specification,  and  paragraphs  4(e)  and  (g),  and  7  of  the 
amendment to the compliance specification, because Respond-
ent’s answers to those paragraphs were deficient; (b) strike the 
affirmative  defenses  stated  in  paragraphs  1–3  and  5–6  of  Re-
spondent’s  answers;  and  (c)  grant  partial  summary  judgment.  
As discussed below, I find that several aspects of the General 
Counsel’s motion have merit.

1. Should any allegations in the compliance specification 

and amendment thereto be deemed admitted?

a. Paragraph 2—The backpay period

The  General  Counsel  alleged  that  the  backpay period  runs 
from  October  24,  2008,  to  February  8,  2013.    Respondent 
agreed  that  the  October  24,  2008  start  date  is  correct,  and 
acknowledged that it offered to reinstate Membrino on Febru-
ary  8,  2013.    However,  Respondent  also  asserted  that  “the 

PESSOA CONSTRUCTION CO.

regular and overtime hours should be based on the three calen-
dar quarters prior to Membrino’s discharge, and calculated that 
Membrino worked an average of 444.6 regular hours and 61.1 
overtime  hours  per  calendar  quarter,  and  was  entitled  to 
$108,397.90  in  net  backpay  (after  deducting  interim  earnings 
from gross backpay of $199,285.90).3  (GC Exhs. 1(d), par. 4; 
1(g).)    Respondent  denied  virtually  all  of  those  allegations, 
maintaining  that:  Membrino’s  regular  and  overtime  earnings 
and hours should be determined based on when he was availa-
ble to work, when he would have worked with employee S.M. 
until laid off, and/or the hours that replacement employee R.S. 
(or other unspecified comparable employees) worked; and that 
the  regular  and  overtime  wage  rates  were  $18/hour  and 
$27/hour, 
that 
Membrino worked an average of 425.5 regular hours and 34.2 
overtime hours per calendar quarter, and further contended that 
Membrino’s gross backpay figure was only $912  (all of which 
was based on the fourth quarter of 2008).  (GC Exh. 1(i), par. 4; 
id. (Exhibit 1).)

  Respondent  also  asserted 

respectively. 

I agree with the General Counsel that Respondent’s answer 
is deficient as to the claims that gross backpay should be meas-
ured based on when Membrino would have been laid off, the 
wages  that  Membrino  would  have  earned  had  he  continued 
working  with  employee  S.M.,  and  the  amount  of  wages  that 
employee  R.S.  earned  as  Membrino’s  alleged  replacement.  
Although these claims raise issues that are within Respondent’s 
knowledge,  Respondent  provided  no  supporting  dates  or  fig-
ures, again leaving the General Counsel to speculate as to what 
countervailing gross backpay formulae or amounts Respondent 
believes are accurate.  

backpay  period  terminated  no  later  than  December  1,  2008.”  
(GC Exh. 1(f).)

The Board’s decision in Aneco, Inc., 330 NLRB 969 (2000), 
is  instructive  as  to  whether  Respondent’s bare  assertion of  an 
alternative  end  date  to  the  backpay  period  was  sufficient.    In 
that case, which involved a compliance specification based on 
an  unlawful  refusal  to  hire  the  discriminatee,  the  respondent 
asserted in its answer that the backpay period would have only 
lasted  2  weeks  because  the  discriminatee  only  needed  that 
amount of time to either organize the respondent’s employees 
or  determine  that  such  efforts  were  futile.    Id.  at  970.    The 
Board  denied  the  General  Counsel’s  motion  for  summary 
judgment  on  this  point,  finding  that  respondent’s  answer  was 
sufficiently  specific  insofar  as  it specified  both  an  alternative 
date for when the backpay period closed, and the basis for the 
alternative date.  Id. at 971.

Based  on  the  Board’s  analysis  in  Aneco,  Inc.,  supra,  I  find 
that  Respondent’s  answer  to  paragraph  2  of  the  compliance 
specification was deficient.  Although Respondent provided an 
alternative date (December 1, 2008) for the end of the backpay 
period,  Respondent  did  not  state  a  basis  for  that  alternative 
date,  thereby  forcing  the  General  Counsel  to  speculate  about 
what theory or evidence Respondent relied upon for its claim.  
Since Respondent did not explain adequately its failure to deny 
the allegations in paragraph 2 of the compliance specification in 
a manner consistent with Board Rule 102.56(b), I will grant the 
General Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment as to 
paragraph 2, and deem paragraph 2 of the compliance specifi-
cation as admitted as true.2  

b. Paragraphs 3 and 4—Gross backpay formula 

and calculation

In paragraph 3 of the compliance specification, the General 
Counsel alleged that an appropriate measure of gross backpay 
would be the amount that Membrino would have earned had he 
been employed by Respondent throughout the backpay period.  
(GC Exh. 1(d), par. 3.)  Respondent asserted in its answer that 
the appropriate measure of gross backpay was: the difference in 
wages that Membrino would have earned until he became una-
vailable  for  work  under  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation 
(DOT)  regulations;  the  difference  in  wages  that  Membrino 
would  have  earned  until  he  would  have been  laid  off  by  Re-
spondent;  the  amount  of  wages  that  Membrino  would  have 
earned based on work performed with employee S.M.; and/or 
the  amount  of  wages  that  replacement  employee  R.S.  earned.  
(GC Exh. 1(f), par. 3.)

The  parties  disagreed  along  similar  lines  regarding  how  to 
calculate  gross  backpay.    Specifically,  in  paragraph  4  of  the 
compliance  specification,  the  General  Counsel  alleged  gross 
backpay  should  be  calculated  by  adding  Membrino’s  average 
regular  earnings  per  calendar  quarter  to  his  average  overtime 
earnings  per  calendar  quarter,  using  a  regular  wage  rate  of 
$22/hour  and  an  overtime  rate  of  $33/hour  (time-and-a-half).  
The  General  Counsel  also  alleged  that  Membrino’s  average 
                                                          

2 To the extent that Respondent raised an affirmative defense based 
on par. 2 of its answer, I will also grant the General Counsel’s motion 
to strike that defense.

I also agree that Respondent’s answer is deficient as to the 
calculations  that  Respondent  proffered  for  Membrino’s  wage 
rate,  the  average  regular  and  overtime  hours  that  Membrino 
worked, and the amount of gross backpay.  Respondent did not 
state  the  basis  for  its  assertion  that  Membrino’s  regular  wage 
rate would only have been $18/hour during the backpay period, 
nor did it state the basis for its calculations of Membrino’s av-
erage regular and overtime hours worked per calendar quarter, 
or  its  calculation  of  gross  backpay.    Once  again,  Respondent 
should have stated the bases for its calculations in its answer, 
since issues such as Membrino’s wage rate and hours worked 
are  within  Respondent’s  knowledge.    See  Shenandoah  Coal 
Co.,  312  NLRB  30,  31  (1993)  (granting  motion  for  partial 
summary  judgment  regarding  the  amount  of  hourly  wage  in-
creases  because  the  respondent did not propose  an  alternative 
figure or state the basis for such a figure). 

On  the  other  hand,  I  find  that  Respondent  satisfied  the  re-
quirements  of  Board  Rule  102.56(b)–(c)  with  its  claim  that 
gross backpay should account for the “difference in wages that 
[Membrino]  would  have  earned  until  he  was  unavailable  for 
work pursuant to [DOT] regulations.”  (GC Exh. 1(f), par. 3.)  
The Board has held that a general denial is sufficient in a re-
spondent’s answer when the respondent is addressing an issue 
beyond  its  knowledge.    See  Urban  Constructors,  327  NLRB 
1220,  1221  fn.  3  (2000).    That  is  precisely  the  situation  here 
                                                          

3 On  the  first  day  of  trial,  the  General  Counsel  revised  its  net 

backpay figure to $107,929.  (GC Exh. 1(k).)

4

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

regarding Membrino’s availability to work during the backpay 
period  pursuant  to  DOT  regulations,  because  Respondent  did 
not  have  access  to  records  that  (among  other  possible  areas) 
would shed light on Membrino’s medical clearance to work and 
the  validity  of  Membrino’s  CDL  during  the  backpay  period 
until that information was disclosed at trial pursuant to subpoe-
na.  Accordingly, I deny the General Counsel’s motion for par-
tial summary judgment on this issue.   

In sum, in light of the deficiencies in Respondent’s answer to 
paragraphs 3 and 4 of the compliance specification, as well as 
Respondent’s failure to explain adequately why it did not deny 
the allegations in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the compliance specifi-
cation in a manner consistent with Board Rule 102.56(b), I will 
grant the General Counsel’s motion for partial summary judg-
ment, and deem admitted as true the General Counsel’s allega-
tions, on the following issues: 

(i)    The  appropriate  formula  for  calculating  gross  backpay 
(see GC Exh. 1(d), par. 3, but note that the gross backpay fig-
ure remains subject to modification based on periods of time 
that  Membrino  was  unavailable  to  work  pursuant  to  DOT 
regulations);
(ii)  The formulae for calculating regular and overtime earn-
ings per calendar quarter (see GC Exhs. 4(b)–(c));
(iii)  The average regular and overtime hours that Membrino 
worked  in  the  three  quarters  before  he  was  discharged  (see 
GC Exh. 1(d), pars. 4(d), (f); GC Exh. 1(g), pars. 4(e), (g)); 
and
(iv)  Membrino’s regular wage rate (see GC Exh. 1(d), par. 
4(h).4

See  Urban  Constructors,  327  NLRB  at  1220–1221  (granting 
motion for summary judgment because the respondent’s answer 
to the compliance specification gave no alternative wage rates, 
backpay  periods,  or  gross  backpay  totals  even  though  those 
issues  concerned  matters  within the  respondent’s  knowledge); 
Structural Finishing, 296 NLRB 439, 440–441 (1989) (same).

c. Paragraph 7—net backpay calculation

In paragraph 7 of the amendment to the compliance specifi-
cation,  the  General  Counsel  alleged  that  Respondent  would 
make  whole  Membrino  as  required  by  the  Board’s  order  by 
paying  $108,397.90,  plus  interest  compounded  daily  and  Re-
spondent’s  share  of  FICA  contributions.    (GC  Exh.  1(g),  par. 
7.)  Respondent offered a general denial to the General Coun-
sel’s  net  backpay  calculations,  and  asserted  that  Membrino 
would  be  made  whole  with  a  net  backpay  amount  of  $912.5  
                                                          

4 To the extent that Respondent raised affirmative defenses based on 
these  aspects  of  pars.  3  and  4  of  its  answers  (with  the  exception  of 
defenses based on Membrino’s alleged unavailability to work pursuant 
to DOT regulations), I will also grant the General Counsel’s motion to 
strike those defenses.

5 Respondent also asserted that interest should not be compounded 
daily,  and  that  the General  Counsel’s  net  backpay  figure  did  not  ac-
count  for  Membrino’s  Federal,  State,  and  social  security  taxes  that 
would  need  to  be  deducted.    (GC  Exh.  1(i),  par.  7.)    I  have  not  ad-
dressed those portions of Respondent’s answer because I am bound to 
follow the  Board’s  ruling  that  interest  on  any  backpay  owed  to 

(GC Exh. 1(i), par. 7.)  The General Counsel asserts that Re-
spondent  failed  to  supply  a  rationale  for  its  calculation of  net 
backpay as $912.  While that point is valid, I nonetheless deny 
the  General  Counsel’s  motion  for  summary  judgment  on  this 
issue  because  the  amount  of  net  backpay  is  not  within  Re-
spondent’s knowledge since net backpay is affected by (among 
other things) Membrino’s interim earnings during the backpay 
period.  Respondent’s general denial of the net backpay figure 
in paragraph 7 of the amendment to the compliance specifica-
tion was therefore sufficient under the Board’s case law.  See 
Urban Constructors, 327 NLRB at 1221 fn. 3.

Finally, I note that while I have granted portions of the Gen-
eral Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment, I will still 
address those issues on the factual merits, which are discussed 
below.  Turning, therefore, to the factual merits, on the entire 
record,6 including my observation of the demeanor of the wit-
                                                                                            
Membrino    must  be  compounded  daily,  and  Respondent’s  arguments 
about applicable taxes are not relevant to the compliance specification. 
6 The trial transcripts and exhibits generally are accurate, but I make 
the following transcript corrections to clarify the record: p. 7, L. 15: the 
speaker was Mr. Horton; p. 301, L. 8: “self” should be “salt?”; p. 327, 
L. 23: the speaker was Mr. Avakian; p. 328, L. 1: the speaker was Mr. 
Avakian; p. 348,  L.  8: ”paid”  should  be  “applied”; p. 375,  L.  18:  the 
speaker  was  Mr.  Avakian;  and  p.  661,  L.  14:  “redacted”  should  be 
“rejected.” 

I  note  that  on  November  20,  2013,  I  issued  an  order  directing  the 
parties to file corrected versions of certain exhibits to redact personal 
identifiable information and provide pages that were omitted.  Pursuant 
to that order, the parties submitted the following corrected exhibits: GC 
Exhs. 9, 25(a)–(b); R. Exhs. 16–19, 32, 34.  I have replaced the original 
copies of those exhibits in my exhibit file with the corrected versions, 
and I have placed the original copies in a sealed envelope in case they 
are needed for review.  Since the electronic file still contains both the 
original  and  corrected  exhibits,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  take  ap-
propriate steps to ensure that the original exhibits in the electronic file 
are handled in a way that will ensure they (and the personal identifica-
tion information they contain) remain confidential.

I also note that after reviewing the trial transcripts, I determined that 
I prematurely ended a line of questioning during trial related to whether 
Membrino’s  character  for  truthfulness  could  be  challenged  based  on 
certain evidence under Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  (Tr. 
392–394.)  Accordingly, on December 4, 2013, I issued an order direct-
ing the General Counsel to provide information to complete the record 
on that issue.  The General Counsel complied, and after reviewing the 
supplemental information and arguments of the parties’,  I determined 
(as explained in more detail in an order that I issued on December 19, 
2013) that the information is not admissible under Rule 609 because of 
the passage of time, the fact that any probative value of the evidence 
does not substantially outweigh its prejudicial nature, and the fact that 
Respondent did not provide reasonable written notice of its intent to use 
Rule  609  evidence  such  that  the  General  Counsel  would  have  a  fair 
opportunity to oppose the request.  (See FRE 609(b).)  I also found that 
to the extent that Respondent might wish to use the proffered Rule 609 
evidence  to  establish  that  Membrino  made  false  statements  on  job 
applications to interim employers, I note that the evidence is cumula-
tive and irrelevant in light of the admissions that Membrino made else-
where in the record.  (See, e.g., R. Exh. 1, p. 7.)  The pleadings related 
to  my  Rule  609  inquiry  are  part  of  the  record  in  this  case,  but  shall 
remain under seal (except as needed for possible review on appeal or 
for other valid purposes).  I also recommend that the Board take appro-
priate steps to ensure that any pleadings in the electronic file that are

nesses,  and  after  considering  the  briefs  filed  by  the  General 
Counsel and Respondent, I make the following

FINDINGS OF FACT

A. William Membrino—Background

For the most part, William Membrino has worked as a com-
mercial truckdriver since 1992 or 1993.  In connection with that 
profession,  Membrino  obtained  a  class  A  commercial  drivers 
license (CDL) that enabled him to drive a variety of commer-
cial vehicles.  (Tr. 302–303.)
In  2007,  Julio  Pessoa 

(Respondent’s  owner)  asked 
Membrino  to  return  to Respondent  (a  highway  construction 
contractor and subcontractor) as one of its commercial drivers.7  
Membrino  agreed,  and  joined  Respondent  in  June  2007,  as  a 
salaried  truckdriver,  earning  $25  per  hour  and  maintaining  a 
standard 40-hour workweek (with no overtime paid).  (Tr. 37, 
564, 593, 736–737, 739; GC Exh. 27.)  In January 2008, how-
ever, Membrino became an hourly employee, and thus was not 
guaranteed a fixed number of work hours per week.  With the 
new, hourly arrangement, Membrino earned $22 per hour, but 
also earned time-and-a-half overtime pay for any hours that he 
worked  above  the  standard  40-hour  workweek.8    (Tr.  37–38, 
564, 739–740; GC Exh. 27.)  

As a driver with a class A CDL, Membrino was authorized 
to  drive  (and  did  drive)  a  variety  of  commercial  vehicles  for 
Respondent,  including  the  following  vehicles  (among  others) 
that could only be driven with a class A CDL: tractor trailers; 
lowboys;9 and  flatbeds.    (Tr.  73–74,  420–421,  569–570,  606, 
640–643, 645–646, 656, 735–738; GC Exhs. 20(b), 21, 23(a), 
(c).)  Starting in March 2008, however, Respondent most often 
asked Membrino to drive one of its dump trucks (truck 5067), 
even though that vehicle only required a class B CDL.  (Tr. 74–
78, 425, 428–430, 608–609; R. Exh. 2.)

On  August  11,  2008,  a  Maryland  District  Court  judge  sus-
pended  Membrino’s  CDL  because  he  failed  to  pay  a  fine.  
Membrino’s CDL remained suspended until October 24, 2008.  
(R.  Exh.  4.)    Nevertheless,  Membrino  continued  working  for 
Respondent as a commercial truckdriver despite having a sus-
pended CDL.  (GC Exh. 27.)  There is no reliable evidence that 
Respondent  learned  that  Membrino’s  license  was  suspended 
                                                                                            
related to my Rule 609 inquiry are handled in a way that is comparable 
to maintaining those documents under seal.

Finally,  although  I  have  included  several  citations to  the  record  to 
highlight particular testimony or exhibits, I emphasize that my findings 
and conclusions are not based solely on those specific record citations, 
but rather are based on my review and consideration of the entire record 
for this case.

7 Membrino also worked for Respondent from 2003 or 2004 to June 
2006,  when  Membrino  took  a  job  with  another  employer.    (Tr.  639, 
735.)

8 To illustrate, if Membrino worked 45 hours in 1 week as a salaried 
employee, he would only be paid for 40 hours at the $25 per hour rate.  
By  contrast,  if  Membrino  worked  45  hours  in  1  week  as  an  hourly 
employee, he would be paid for 40 hours at the regular $22 per hour 
rate, and $33 per hour for the additional 5 hours of overtime.

9 A lowboy is used to transport equipment from one jobsite to anoth-

er.  (Tr. 606.)

during  this  time  period.10    However,  when  Respondent  has 
learned  that  other  drivers  on  its  payroll  had  suspended  CDLs 
(e.g.,  for  failure  to  pay  child  support),  Respondent’s  practice 
has been to prohibit those drivers from working until they re-
solved the problems with their license.  (Tr. 144, 414–418, 444, 
628.)

B. October 23, 2008—Respondent Discharges Membrino 

in Violation of the Act

On  October  23,  2008,  Respondent  discharged  Membrino.  
The Board has ruled that Respondent discharged Membrino for 
discriminatory  reasons  (specifically,  because  of  Membrino’s 
union  activities)  in  violation of  Section 8(a)(3)  and  (1)  of  the 
Act.  Pessoa Construction Co., 356 NLRB No. 157, slip op. at 
1, 8–9, 11 (2011).

C. Membrino’s Job Searches, Unemployment 

Benefits, and Illness

1. October 2008 through March 2010—Membrino’s 
search for employment and Membrino’s application 

for unemployment benefits

After  being  terminated  by  Respondent,  Membrino  experi-
enced his first day of unemployment on October 24, 2008.  (Tr. 
26.)  That same day, Membrino also began searching for a new 
job, relying on sources such as the Washington Post, the inter-
net, job listings at the State of Maryland unemployment agency, 
job leads from family and friends, and occasional referrals from 
the Union.  Membrino checked for jobs in the Washington, DC 
area, in and around Jessup, Maryland, and occasionally in Vir-
ginia.    (Tr.  157–158,  229–230,  250,  260–265,  276,  359–360, 
383.)    Every  quarter,  Membrino  completed  and  submitted  a 
“Claimant Expense and Search for Work Report” to the Board, 
on which he listed multiple employers that he contacted to in-
quire about and apply for job openings.11  (R. Exh. 1; see also 
                                                          

10 I do not credit Membrino’s testimony that he paid the fine “well in 
advance” of October 24, 2008, the date that the suspension was lifted.  
Membrino asserted that there must have been a delay in processing his 
payment of the fine, but that testimony was speculative and uncorrobo-
rated.  (Tr. 315–316.)

I also do not credit Membrino’s assertion that Respondent knew his 
CDL was suspended.  Membrino testified (without corroboration) that 
he borrowed money from Pessoa to pay the fine underlying the suspen-
sion.    Even  if  that  testimony  is  accurate,  it  does  not  follow  that  Re-
spondent knew that Membrino’s CDL was suspended, or that Respond-
ent  authorized  Membrino  to  drive  despite  having  a  suspended  CDL.  
(Tr. 316–318.)   

11 I credit Membrino’s testimony that he actually applied for a broad 
variety of jobs when he could not secure a job as a truckdriver (includ-
ing job applications that he did not list in his reports to the Board), but 
still  had  trouble  finding  a  job  even  after  expanding  his  search.  
Membrino  was  clear  and  forthright  in  explaining  that  he  was  in  dire 
need of  employment because he lacked alternated sources of income, 
and accordingly I have credited his testimony on this issue in full.  (Tr. 
368–373, 380–381, 383, 391, 399.)

I also credit Membrino’s testimony that he used a notebook to doc-
ument  his  efforts  to  find  work,  but  lost  the  notebook  when  someone 
broke  into  his  car.    Membrino’s  testimony  about  the  notebook  was 
straightforward  and  plausible,  and  was  not  rebutted  by  any  evidence 
that cast doubt on his explanation of what happened to the notebook.  
(Tr. 220–224, 229–230, 381.)  

6

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

 

Tr. 222–223.)  Despite these efforts, Membrino did not find a 
job until April 2010.12

In the same time period, Membrino also applied for unem-
ployment compensation.  Initially, the State of Maryland denied 
Membrino’s  application. 
In  February  2009,  however, 
Membrino won his appeal of the initial decision to deny bene-
fits,  and  the  State  of  Maryland  awarded  him  unemployment 
compensation  retroactive  to  October  26,  2008.    Thereafter, 
Membrino was subject to, and complied with, the State of Mar-
yland’s requirement that recipients of unemployment compen-
sation  demonstrate  that  they  are  actively  searching  for  work.  
Membrino’s  unemployment  benefits  ran  out  in  March  2010.  
(Tr. 45, 157–158, 273, 552; R. Exh. 34.)

2. November 3–25, 2008—Membrino unavailable 

to work due to illness13

On  November  3,  2008,  Membrino  went  to  the  emergency 
room at Doctors Community Hospital because he was experi-
encing chest pain and numbness in his arms.  Doctors Commu-
nity  Hospital  medical  personnel  diagnosed  Membrino  with:
angina  pectoris—unstable;  hypertension—malignant;  ischemic 
heart disease—acute; and obesity.  (Tr. 163–164; GC Exh. 9, p. 
1.)

Later on November 3, Doctors Community Hospital person-
nel  transferred  Membrino  to  Washington  Adventist  Hospital, 
where he underwent a coronary angiography (a test to examine 
a patient’s coronary arteries for possible blockage).  During the 
procedure,  doctors  performed  a  percutaneous  coronary  inter-
vention  (a/k/a  PCI  or  angioplasty)  and  placed  a  drug-eluting 
(drug coated) stent in his circumflex artery, which was totally 
occluded.  Another lesion was treated medically.  (GC Exh. 11; 
Tr. 164, 166–167, 242–243.)

On  November  4,  2008,  Membrino  was  discharged  from 
Washington Adventist Hospital, with the direction to follow up 
with a physician in 1–2 weeks, and the following restrictions: 
no heavy lifting or bathing  for 2 weeks; and no driving for 2 
days.    Membrino  was  also  prescribed  medication  to  address 
(among other things) high blood pressure and cholesterol.  (GC 
Exhs. 10–11; see also Tr. 168–169, 227–228.)  Membrino ad-
mitted  to  the  Board  (on  his  quarterly  search  for  work  report) 
that he was unable to work from November 3–25, 2008, due to 
illness.  (R. Exh. 1, p. 1.)

3. April 9–27, 2009—Membrino’s CDL suspended

On April 9, 2009, a Maryland District Court judge suspended 
Membrino’s CDL because Membrino failed to pay a fine.  The 
                                                          

12 On or about March 27, 2009, Membrino tried to start an auto sales 
business  under  the  name  “Cee-Moni  Auto.”    Membrino  filed  a  trade 
name  application  (for  a  $75  fee)  as part  of this business  venture,  but 
abandoned  the  idea  because  he  did  not  have  a  physical  address  on 
which to locate the business (one of the requirements for obtaining an 
automobile dealer’s license).  Membrino did not earn any income from 
the Cee-Moni Auto business venture.  (Tr. 160–163, 250–251; GC Exh. 
8; see also R. Exh. 12 (noting that Cee-Moni Auto is still “active” as an 
entity, but that status expires on March 27, 2014).)

13 In reviewing and discussing the medical records in this section, I 
took judicial notice of information on the National Institute of Health’s 
website  (www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/medlineplus.html)  regarding 
the meaning of certain medical terms.     

District  Court  judge  lifted  the  suspension  on  April  27,  2009.  
(R.  Exh.  3  (initial  notice  of  possible  suspension  was  sent  on 
March 17, 2009).)

4. April 22, 2009—Membrino’s followup doctor visit

On April 22, 2009, Membrino went to Baden Medical Ser-
vices to follow up on his November 2008 hospital stay.14  Med-
ical personnel refilled Membrino’s blood pressure and choles-
terol medications (which he had stopped taking because he ran 
out).    The  office  visit  was  otherwise  uneventful.15    (GC  Exh. 
12; see also Tr. 172.)   

D. April 2010—February 2013: Membrino’s 

Interim Employment

1. April 2010—Portable Storage of Maryland

On  or  about  April  23,  2010,  Membrino applied  for  a  truck 
driving  position  with  Portable  Storage  of  Maryland  (a/k/a 
Smartbox), a  company that leases portable storage containers.  
On  his  job  application,  Membrino  falsely  answered  “no”  to 
questions  asking  whether  his  driver’s  license  had  ever  been 
suspended or revoked, and whether he had a criminal record.16  
(Tr. 333–334, 493–494, 497; R. Exh. 16; see also Tr. 175–176 
(noting that Membrino learned of the job opening when he saw 
a job listing in the Washington Post); R. Exh. 1, p. 7.))  

In  connection  with  Membrino’s  job  application,  Portable 
Storage required Membrino to complete a physical and a drug 
test.    Membrino  passed  both  requirements,  and  on  April  23, 
2010, received a  medical examiner’s certificate (a/k/a Depart-
                                                          

14 Membrino did not see a doctor at an earlier date (as had been rec-
ommended, see GC Exh. 11, p. 2) because he did not have insurance or 
sufficient funds to pay for a doctor’s office visit.  (Tr. 171, 244–245.)  
Membrino  subsequently became  eligible  for  Medicaid,  and  thereafter 
made an appointment at Baden Medical Services.  (Tr. 172.)

15 Medical  records  from  Baden  Medical  Services  state  that 
Membrino’s November 2008 hospital stay occurred after a myocardial 
infarction (MI, or heart attack), but I do not give weight to those entries 
because they  were based on Membrino’s own inaccurate report about 
the  nature  of  his  hospital  stay.    Indeed,  Membrino  inaccurately  told 
Baden  Medical  Services  medical  staff  that  he  had  a  coronary  artery 
bypass  procedure  at  Washington  Adventist  Hospital,  when  no  such 
procedure was noted in the discharge paperwork that Washington Ad-
ventist Hospital prepared in November 2008.  (Compare GC Exh. 12, 
pp. 2, 5 with GC Exh. 11; see also Tr. 174 (Membrino explained that he 
told the doctor at Baden Medical Services that he had a bypass proce-
dure because he (Membrino) “did not know the difference”), 248, 280–
281.))  For similar reasons, I do not give weight to Membrino’s state-
ments (made in two Board affidavits, and to a former coworker) that he 
had  a  heart  attack  in  November  2008.    (See  Tr.  126–127,  241,  557.)  
Membrino does not have medical training (see Tr. 175), and as a result 
he  unintentionally  mischaracterized  the  nature  of  his  hospital  stay  on 
multiple occasions. 

In short, I find that the records that medical professionals at Doctors 
Community Hospital and Washington Adventist Hospital prepared on 
November  3–4,  2008,  regarding  Membrino’s  medical  condition  and 
care (see GC Exhs. 9–11) to be the most reliable sources of information 
regarding the nature of Membrino’s November 2008 hospital stay, and 
I have accordingly relied on those documents to make the factual find-
ings set forth herein.

16 There is no evidence that Portable Storage took any adverse em-
ployment action against Membrino because of false statements that he 
made on his job application.

ment of Transportation (DOT) card) in which the medical ex-
aminer  certified  that  Membrino  was  qualified  to  work  as  a 
commercial  driver.    The  temporary  DOT  card  that  Membrino 
received was valid for 3 months (until July 23, 2010) instead of 
a  longer  period  because  Membrino  had  high  blood  pressure 
readings  that  would  require  some  followup.17    (Tr.  176–178; 
GC Exh. 13.)

On  or  about  April  27,  2010,  Portable  Storage  hired 
Membrino as a commercial truckdriver.  Although he applied at 
the  company’s  facility  in  Maryland,  the  company  asked 
Membrino  to  work  out  of  one  of  its  warehouses  in  northern 
Virginia.    Specifically,  Membrino  was  expected  to  pick  up  a 
truck in Maryland, and then drive to northern Virginia, where 
he would be available to deliver or pick up storage containers 
to/from customers.  (Tr. 182–183.)

After approximately 4 workdays, a Portable Storage manager 
advised Membrino that the company was going to eliminate his 
position  because  the  company  did  not  think  it  was  cost-
effective for Membrino to be in northern Virginia all day since
there was no guarantee that customers would need assistance at 
that location.18  Membrino’s employment with Portable Storage 
therefore  ended  on  April  30,  with  Membrino  earning  a  gross 
income of $490.  (Tr. 183–184, 258–259; GC Exhs. 2, 32–33.)

2. May 2010—Aggregate Industries

On or about May 14, 2010, Membrino applied for a ready-
mix  truck  driving  position  with  Aggregate  Industries  (Aggre-
gate), a building materials company that provides “aggregates” 
such  as  crushed  stone,  sand,  gravel,  ready-mixed  concrete, 
recycled  concrete, and  asphalt.    On  his  job  application, 
Membrino falsely answered “no” to a question asking whether 
his  driver’s  license  had  ever  been  suspended  or  revoked,  and 
also  falsely  stated  that  he  had  worked  as  the  self-employed 
owner of Membrino Trucking from October 2008 through Feb-
ruary  2010.19    (Tr.  184,  187,  671;  GC  Exh.  14  (noting  that 
Membrino applied for the position after seeing it listed in the 
Washington Post).)  
                                                          

17 At  the  time,  Membrino  did not  have  the  money  to  purchase  his 

blood pressure medication.  (Tr. 178.)

18 Respondent attempted to establish (via Christina Norwood, a rep-
resentative from Portable Storage) that Membrino voluntarily quit his 
job at Portable Storage by simply failing to report for work.  I do not 
credit that testimony because Norwood was not Membrino’s supervisor 
and did not have personal knowledge about the circumstances that led 
to the end of Membrino’s employment, and no business records were 
offered  (e.g.,  from  Membrino’s  personnel  file)  to  support  proposition 
that Membrino voluntarily stopped reporting for work.  (Tr. 502–508.)  
Membrino’s  explanation  for  how  his  employment  at  Portable  Storage 
ended therefore was not rebutted by any reliable evidence. 

19 Membrino did own and operate Membrino Trucking from 1998 to 
2002, but admitted that he did not do so from 2008 to 2010 as stated on 
the  job  application  that  he  submitted  to  Aggregate  Industries.  
Membrino  explained  that  he  listed  this  false  self-employment  infor-
mation  on  his  application  because  he  thought  his  application  would 
look better if it did not include gaps in his employment.  Membrino did 
not earn any money from Membrino Trucking from October 24, 2008, 
to February 8, 2013.  (Tr. 159, 186.)

There is no evidence that Aggregate Industries took any adverse em-
ployment action against Membrino because of false statements that he 
made on his job application.  (Tr. 706.)

Aggregate required Membrino to complete a DOT physical 
before commencing work with the company.  Membrino passed 
his DOT physical, and accordingly, on May 27, 2010, received 
a  DOT  card  in  which  the  medical  examiner  certified  that 
Membrino was qualified to work as a commercial driver.  The 
temporary  DOT  card  that  Membrino  received  was  valid  for  3
months  (until  August  27,  2010)  because  Membrino’s  blood 
pressure  continued  to  be  high.    (Tr.  188–190;  GC  Exh.  15.)  
Membrino  also  passed  a  preemployment  physical  that  Aggre-
gate directed him to complete.  (Tr. 188, 190.)

On or about June 2, 2010, Membrino began working for Ag-
gregate.    (See  Tr.  106;  R. Exh. 1.)   His  employment  with  the 
company,  however,  was  not  incident-free.    For  example,  on 
August 31, Aggregate suspended Membrino for 2 days without 
pay  because  he  reported  to  work  without a  valid  DOT  card 
(since his temporary card expired on August 27).  (GC Exh. 16 
(Membrino’s suspension applied to September 2–3, 2010); see 
also Tr. 191–193, 254, 686 (noting that Membrino subsequently 
obtained  a  new,  3-month  DOT  card  and  returned  to  work).)20  
In addition, on October 11, Membrino received a verbal warn-
ing because he left a truck water valve on and thereby made a 
load of concrete too wet, and because he cleaned dry concrete 
off of his truck chute in a location at the facility that was not 
appropriate for that task.  (Tr. 194–195; GC Exh. 17.)

On  August  30,  2010,  a  Maryland  District  Court  judge  sus-
pended Membrino’s CDL because of child support noncompli-
ance.    The  District  Court  judge  lifted  the  suspension  on  De-
cember 2, 2010.21  (Tr. 311; R. Exh. 3 (initial notice of possible 
suspension was sent on August 9, 2010).)
                                                          

20 The parties did not introduce any additional DOT cards into evi-
dence  for  subsequent  portions  of  the  backpay  period.    Membrino  ex-
plained, however, that he threw away his copies of expired DOT cards 
because  if  he  accidentally  showed  an  expired  DOT  card  to  a  DOT 
officer, the officer could prohibit Membrino from driving for 24 hours 
and also  impose  a  fine.    (Tr.  181–182, 255.)    In  addition,  I  note  that 
there is no evidence that Membrino failed any DOT physicals required 
by his subsequent employers, or that Membrino worked for any subse-
quent employer without a valid DOT card.  (See Tr. 79, 130 (the Gen-
eral Counsel’s compliance officer recalled seeing DOT cards that were 
valid through 2012); see also Tr. 190–192 (indicating that Respondent 
never  required  Membrino  to  complete  a  DOT  physical  or  provide  a 
valid  DOT  card);  Tr.  520–522  (Respondent  did  not  normally  check 
DOT  cards  to  ensure  they  were  up  to  date,  and  instead  relied  on  its 
drivers to keep track of their records).)

21 Membrino testified that when he learned that his license was sus-
pended, he notified a supervisor at Aggregate, and that supervisor did 
not allow him to drive.  (Tr. 313.)  I do not credit Membrino’s  testimo-
ny on this point.  Membrino admitted that he had trouble remembering 
whether  he  notified  Aggregate  that  his  license  was  suspended,  and 
Membrino’s testimony that he notified a supervisor at Aggregate about 
the  issue  is  not  corroborated  by  any  documentation  (such  as 
Membrino’s termination letter) from his personnel file from Aggregate.  
I also do not credit Membrino’s testimony that the judge in his child 
support case authorized him to drive for work purposes notwithstanding 
having a suspended license.  At best, Membrino’s uncorroborated tes-
timony only established that the judge in his child support case author-
ized  him to  drive  for  work  purposes  on a  suspended  license in  2005, 
well  before  the  suspensions  at  issue  here  occurred.    There  is  no  evi-
dence that the purported authorization to drive on a suspended license 
extended to any suspension occurring after 2005, nor is there evidence 

8

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

Ultimately,  Aggregate  decided  to  terminate  Membrino  on 
December 17, 2010, stating the following rationale for its deci-
sion:

Dear Mr. Membrino:
We  regret  to  inform  you  that  the  Company  has  decided  to 
terminate your employment effective immediately.  We have 
come  to  this  difficult  decision  because  you  have  repeatedly 
violated our work rules with regard to safety and cooperation 
since starting with the Company in June of this year.
On December 17, 2010, you backed your mixer truck into a 
parking  space  at  the  plant,  pinning  your  concrete  chute  be-
tween a tree and the truck, damaging the chute bearings.  You 
also left the chute down, which is further violation of standard 
operating procedures.  A few days before, you had a flat spot 
on the rollers, which would have been avoided had you con-
ducted a proper pre-trip inspection.  The importance of con-
ducting a pre-trip and looking for this particular problem was 
addressed  during  driver  meetings  as  recently  as  last  month.  
These  incidents  highlight  our  concerns  with  regard  to  your 
ability to operate safely.
On July 29, 2010 your load of concrete was rejected by the 
ICC for being too wet.  Had you followed proper plant operat-
ing procedures, this would not have occurred.
On August 31, 2010, you received a two day suspension for 
reporting to  work  without a  valid  DOT physical  card.  Fol-
lowing your return, you failed to report to work or to call for a 
scheduled night pour, which the Dispatch office had discussed 
with you just hours before.
In October 2010, you received two violations of work rules; 
one for chipping concrete into the grass at the plant, instead of 
in the designated washout/disposal area and the other for fail-
ure to close the water valve on your mixer truck, which re-
sulted in a wet load.
The incidents outlined above suggest that you have failed to 
meet  the  essential  functions  of  the  job  within  your  first  six 
months of employment.  We regret that this decision had to be 
made, but feel it is in the best interest of the Company.  Please 
return  all  company-issued items to  your immediate  supervi-
sor.  You are not eligible for rehire.
Sincerely,
Terri L. Coomaraswamy
Human Resources Generalist
Mid-Atlantic Region

(R.  Exh.  5;  see  also  Tr.  680–682,  686.)    Membrino  generally 
did  not  dispute  that  the  incidents  that  Aggregate  listed  in  the 
termination letter occurred as described, but he did assert that 
the  incidents  were  unintentional.    (Tr.  195–202.)    Nothing  in 
                                                                                            
that Aggregate (or Respondent, for that matter) would have permitted 
Membrino  to  drive  had  it  been  aware  that  Membrino’s  license  was 
suspended  (even  if  the  suspension  was  due  to  child  support  issues). 
(See  Tr.  378,  386–387;  see  also  Tr.  678–679  (noting  that  Aggregate 
would not permit an employee to drive for them if the employee had 
unresolved issues regarding a suspended CDL).)

the evidentiary record contradicts Membrino’s characterization 
of the incidents as unintentional or accidental.

Membrino  earned  a  gross  income  of  $19,361.62  from  his 
employment with Aggregate.  (GC Exh. 2; see also Tr. 60 (not-
ing that Membrino’s W-2 form for Aggregate uses the company 
name “Bardon,” but lists the same address).)  

3. December 2010—Cylos, Inc.

On December 20, 2010 (the next business day after he was 
terminated  by  Aggregate),  Membrino  applied  for  a  ready-mix 
truck  driving  position  with  Cylos,  Inc  (Cylos),  a  construction 
and ready-mix concrete company.  In completing his job appli-
cation,  Membrino  did  not  respond  to  a  question  that  asked 
whether  any  driver’s  license  had  ever  been  suspended  or  re-
voked, and falsely answered “no” to a question asking if he had 
a  criminal  record.22    Cylos  sent  Membrino  on  a  delivery  run 
with another driver to demonstrate that he (Membrino) could do 
the  job,  and  when  Membrino  returned,  Cylos  hired  him,  with 
Membrino’s  official  starting  date  being  December  21.    (Tr. 
203–204, 342, 463–464, 471; R. Exh. 18; see also R. Exh. 1, p. 
7.)

On or about December 29, 2010, Membrino was at the Cylos 
facility in a standby driver capacity when the dispatcher asked 
him to take a spare truck out for a delivery.  When Membrino 
returned, the dispatcher advised Membrino that he should clean 
the truck and leave for the day because there was no more work 
available.  Membrino complied, but advised the dispatcher that 
he was not able to drain the truck’s water system because of a 
problem with the water pressure.  At the dispatcher’s direction, 
Membrino  brought  the  truck  to  Cylos’  mechanic,  advised  the 
mechanic of the water drainage problem, and then left after the 
mechanic  indicated  that  he  would  take  care  of  the  problem.  
When  Membrino  reported  for  work  the  following  day,  Cylos 
personnel called him to the office and informed him that he was 
being terminated because he left water in the truck lines over-
night,  which  caused  the  truck  water  lines  to  freeze  and  the 
turnoff  valve  to  crack.23    (Tr.  205–206,  255–258;  R.  Exh.  7 
(noting that truck “down time” was required to repair the dam-
age).)  Membrino earned a gross income of $519.40 from his 
employment  with  Cylos  ($431.20  of  that  amount  was  paid  in 
2010, and $88.20 was paid in 2011).  (GC Exh. 2.)

4. January/February 2011—Membrino unemployed

In  January  2011,  Membrino  applied  for  unemployment  in-
surance  benefits.    In  response  to  Membrino’s  application  for 
benefits, Cylos indicated that Membrino worked to the best of 
his ability, but was terminated because he was not qualified for 
the  job.    Membrino  ultimately  was  denied  benefits,  however, 
                                                          

22 Susan  Steadman,  Cylos’  office  manager,  noticed  that  Membrino 
did not answer the question about driver’s  license suspensions on his 
job application, but did not raise the issue before Membrino was termi-
nated.  (Tr. 474, 476.)  There is no evidence that Cylos took adverse 
employment action against Membrino based on the content of his job 
application.

23 I have credited Membrino’s explanation of the events that led to 
his termination by Cylos.  Membrino’s account was essentially unrebut-
ted, because the Cylos representative who testified did not have person-
al knowledge of the incident.  (See Tr. 479–480, 481–483.) 

PESSOA CONSTRUCTION CO.

because he exhausted his benefits at an earlier date.  (Tr. 206, 
484–487; GC Exhs. 30–31.)  

Membrino also searched for a new job, using (among other 
sources) the Washington Post and tips from friends and family 
to find leads on available jobs.  Membrino’s quarterly report to 
the Board indicates that Membrino submitted multiple job ap-
plications in the January to March 2011 time period.  (Tr. 206, 
259–263; R. Exh. 1.)

5. February 2011—A, D & C Management Company

On or about February 25, 2011, Membrino started working 
as  a  part-time,  temporary  commercial  driver  with  A,  D  &  C 
Management  Company  (A,  D  &  C),  a  construction  company.  
Membrino  worked  for  A,  D  &  C  (earning  a  gross  income  of 
$6966) until he voluntarily decided to take a position with an-
other company (Reddy Ice, discussed below) in hopes that he 
would be assigned more hours of work.  (Tr. 206–209, 232; GC 
Exhs. 2, 18; see also Tr. 210 (noting that as hoped, Membrino 
did in fact receive more work hours at Reddy Ice than he was 
getting at A, D & C).)

On May 31, 2011, a Maryland District Court judge suspend-
ed Membrino’s CDL because of child support noncompliance.  
The District Court judge lifted the suspension on July 11, 2011.  
(Tr.  312;  R.  Exh. 3  (initial notice  of  possible  suspension  was 
sent on May 9, 2011).)

6. June 2011—Reddy Ice

Membrino  began  working  for  Reddy  Ice  as  a  tractor-trailer 
driver  (transporting  loads  of  ice)  on  or  about  June  1,  2011.  
Membrino  did  not  take  any  time  off  between  leaving  his  job 
with A D & C and starting his job at Reddy Ice (on a seasonal 
basis).    On  his  job  application,  Membrino  falsely  answered 
“no” to questions asking whether his driver’s license had ever 
been  suspended  or  revoked,  and  whether  he  had  a  criminal 
record.    Membrino  also  falsely  asserted  that  he  worked  for 
Membrino Trucking from December 2008 to December 2010.  
(Tr.  209–210,  345;  R.  Exh.  19;  see  also  Tr.  159,  239 
(Membrino admitted that Membrino Trucking ceased all opera-
tions in 2002); R. Exh. 1, p. 7.)  There is no evidence that Red-
dy Ice took any adverse employment action against Membrino 
because of false statements that he made on his job application.  
While working for Reddy Ice, Membrino received an inter-
view  for  a  job  with  the  Washington  Suburban  Sanitary  Com-
mission (WSSC), a company that he contacted about job open-
ings in January 2011.24  WSSC subsequently offered Membrino 
a job, with a start date of August 1, 2011.  (Tr. 211.)  
                                                          

24 On his job application to WSSC, Membrino falsely stated that he 
was  self-employed  as  the  owner  and  operator  of  Membrino  Delivery 
Service  from  December  2008  to  May  2010.  Membrino  also  falsely: 
stated that he left Aggregate because work was slow (instead of stating 
that he was terminated); did not list Cylos as one of his former employ-
ers; and answered “no” to a question asking whether he had a criminal 
record.  Membrino explained that he made these false statements and 
omissions because he desperately needed work.  (Tr. 212, 349–355; R. 
Exh.  20;  see  also  Tr.  159,  239  (Membrino  admitted  that  Membrino 
Trucking ceased all operations in 2002); R. Exh. 1, p. 7.)  There is no 
evidence  that  WSSC  took  any  adverse  employment  action  against 
Membrino because of false statements or omissions in his job applica-
tion.

When Membrino notified Reddy Ice that he would be leav-
ing  for  a  new  job,  Reddy  Ice  assigned  Membrino’s  route  to 
another  driver,  and  made  Membrino  a  standby  driver  that 
would  only  cover  “open”  routes  that  became  available  (and 
return  home  without  working  if  all  routes  were  covered).  
Membrino worked in the new, standby driver role for approxi-
mately  4–5  days,  and  then  voluntarily  resigned  since  he  was 
slated to begin a new job with WSSC.  Membrino accordingly 
did not work for approximately a week-and-a-half until his new 
job began.  (Tr. 211, 270–271.)  Membrino earned a gross in-
come of $6,426.83 from his employment with Reddy Ice.  (GC 
Exh. 2.)

7. August 2011 to the present—Washington Suburban 

Sanitary Commission (WSSC)

Membrino began working for WSSC on August 1, 2011, and 

has worked for WSSC continuously since that date.  (Tr. 212.)

During  Membrino’s  employment  with  WSSC,  a  Maryland 
District  Court  judge  suspended  Membrino’s  CDL  on  the  fol-
lowing dates:

September  27,  2011  to  March  1,  2012  (suspension  due  to 
child support noncompliance)
December 12, 2012 to January 30, 2013 (suspension due to 
“failure to comply”)

(Tr. 312; R. Exh. 3 (initial notices of possible suspension were 
sent  on  September  7,  2011,  and  November  19,  2012,  respec-
tively).)  There is no reliable evidence that Membrino notified 
WSSC about these suspensions, or that WSSC took any adverse 
employment  action  against  Membrino  because  of  the  suspen-
sions.25  

Membrino earned a gross income of $13,131.69 in 2011, and 
$39,377.74  in  2012,  from  his  employment  with  WSSC.    (GC 
Exh.  2.)    In  addition,  Membrino  earned  a  gross  income  of 
$7099 from his work for WSSC in the first quarter of 2013, but 
the General Counsel concedes that Membrino is not owed any 
net  backpay  for  that  quarter.    (See  GC  Exh.  1(k)  (calculating 
Membrino’s gross backpay and net backpay for the first quarter 
of 2013 as $5,080.90 and $0, respectively).)

E. Pessoa’s Workload and Work force During the 

Backpay Period (2008–2013)

In  the  months  before  and  during  the  backpay  period,  Re-
spondent was struggling financially because of the poor econ-
omy.  Indeed, in the summer of 2008, Respondent laid off sev-
eral  employees,  although  notably,  Membrino  survived  those 
                                                          

25 Membrino  testified  that  during  his  summer  2011  job  interview 
with WSSC, he provided a copy of his driving record (which indicated 
that his license was suspended for child support) and a letter from the 
child  support  office  stating  that  Membrino’s  “driving  privilege  with 
them  was  fine.”    (Tr.  353–354.)    No  such  letter  was  introduced  into 
evidence at trial, however, and in any event, Membrino’s May 31, 2011 
CDL suspension was resolved before he started working for WSSC.

Membrino  also  testified  that  if he  learned  that  his  CDL  was  sus-
pended,  then  he  would  let  his  employers  know.    Membrino  did  not 
identify  an  occasion  where  he  notified  WSSC  that his CDL  was  sus-
pended.  (Tr. 310, 313–314.)

that Respondent turned a profit in 2008 and 2011, but lost mon-
ey in 2009 and 2010); Tr. 622–623 (same).)  

Membrino’s discharge in 2008, as well as employee N.C.’s 
discharge in the same month,27 left Respondent with four CDL 
drivers: employees B.L., J.M., J.R., and P.S.  Respondent, how-
ever,  did  not  stand  pat  with  that  number  of  drivers.    Instead, 
Respondent made the following additional hires that generally 
maintained its complement of drivers at five or higher:

Respondent’s CDL drivers also  continued to work a steady 
amount of hours during the backpay period.  As indicated in the 
chart below, although hourly drivers (like Membrino) saw their 
schedules  fluctuate  from  week  to  week,  none  of  the  hourly 
employees saw their average hours worked change significantly

F. February 8, 2013—Pessoa Offers Membrino 

Reinstatement

On February 8, 2013, Respondent made a valid offer to rein-
state Membrino to his truck driving position at the Company.  
Membrino declined the offer.  (Tr. 26.)
                                                          

30 Employee B.L. was paid as a salaried employee from June 27 to 
November 21, 2008.  I accordingly excluded those weeks when calcu-
lating employee B.L.’s average hours worked for 2008.  (Tr. 537, 542; 
R. Exhs. 29, 33; see also Tr. 577 (explaining that a salaried employee is 
paid for 40 hours every week).)

31 The General Counsel calculated the average hours that employee 
L.P.  worked  for  the  first half  of 2011, but  I  have  not  relied  on  those 
calculations because (as noted above) employee L.P. began working in 
the office part time in February 2011, and the General Counsel included 
those “office” hours in its calculations.  (See GC Exh. 7; fn. 29, supra.) 
32 I excluded employees P.S. and J.M. from the chart because they 
are salaried employees.  (Tr. 577 (salaried employees are paid for 40 
hours every week); GC Exh. 34 (employee P.S. work hours show that 
he worked 40 hours every week, and thus was a salaried employee); Tr. 
35 (same).)

26 Respondent also asked some of its office staff to accept pay cuts in 
the summer of 2008.  Respondent, however, did not ask Membrino to 
take a pay cut.  (Tr. 648–649, 752.)  I also note that in October 2010, 
Respondent  raised  employee  R.S.’s  hourly  rate  from  $18  to  $22  per 
hour, which was consistent with Respondent’s normal practice of giv-
ing raises when drivers are dependable and doing a good job.  (Tr. 551, 
615–616 (noting that employee R.S. had a class A CDL but primarily 
drove a dump truck for Respondent); R. Exh. 32.) 

27 Employee N.C. was only employed by Respondent from October 

6–31, 2008.  (R. Exh. 26.)

28 This figure includes employees B.L., J.M., J.R., and P.S., each of 
whom were hired before the backpay period began, until those employ-

Applicable Legal Standards
A. Compliance Specifications

It is well established that the finding of an unfair labor prac-
tice  is  presumptive  proof  that  some  backpay  is  owed.    The 
Lorge School, 355 NLRB 558, 360 (2010); Laborers Local 158 
(Worthy Bros.), 301 NLRB 35, 36 (1991), enfd. 952 F.2d 1393 
(3d Cir.  1991).    The  General  Counsel’s  burden  in a  backpay 
proceeding is limited to showing the gross backpay due to each 
discriminatee.  The General Counsel has discretion in selecting 
a formula that will closely approximate backpay, and may use 
any  formula  that  approximates  what  the  discriminatee would 
have  earned  had  he  or  she not  been  discriminated  against,  as 
long as the formula is not unreasonable or arbitrary under the 
circumstances.  The Lorge School, 355 NLRB at 360; Perfor-
mance  Friction  Corp.,  335  NLRB  1117,  1117  (2001)  (noting 
that  where  the  Board  is  presented  with  conflicting  backpay 
formulas, the Board must determine the most accurate method 
for determining backpay).

Once the General Counsel meets its burden of showing the 
gross  backpay  owed,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  respondent  to 
establish facts that negate or mitigate its liability.  St. George

B. Credibility Findings

A credibility determination may rely on a variety of factors, 
including  the  context  of  the  witness’ testimony,  the  witness’
demeanor, the weight of the respective evidence, established or 
admitted facts, inherent probabilities, and reasonable inferences 
that may be drawn from the record as a whole.  Relco Locomo-
tives, Inc., 358 NLRB No. 37, slip op. at 12 (2012), enfd. 734 
F.3d 764 (8th Cir. 2013); see also Roosevelt Memorial Medical 
Center, 348 NLRB 1016, 1022 (2006) (noting that an ALJ may 
draw an adverse inference from a party’s failure to call a wit-
ness who may reasonably be assumed to be favorably disposed 
to a party, and who could reasonably be expected to corroborate 
its version of events, particularly when the witness is the par-
ty’s  agent).    Credibility  findings  need  not  be  all-or-nothing 
propositions—indeed, nothing is more common in all kinds of 
judicial decisions than to believe some, but not all, of a witness’
testimony.  Relco Locomotives, 358 NLRB No. 37, slip op. at

Analysis

A. The Backpay Period

As noted above, I resolved this issue when I decided to grant 
the General Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment, as 
well  as  the  General  Counsel’s  motion  to  strike.    However,  in 
the interest of making a complete record, I have analyzed the 
factual and legal merits of this issue below.

The  backpay  period  for  Membrino  runs  from  October  24, 
2008,  through  February  8,  2013  (i.e.,  from  the  day  after  Re-
spondent unlawfully discharged Membrino to the day that Re-
spondent made a valid offer to reinstate Membrino).  (Findings 
of Fact (FOF), secs. B, F.)

B. Gross Backpay Calculation

I resolved many of the issues related to gross backpay when, 
as noted above, I decided to grant the General Counsel’s mo-
tion  for  partial  summary  judgment,  as  well  as  the  General 
Counsel’s motion to strike.  However, in the interest of making 
a complete record, I have analyzed the factual and legal merits 
of Membrino’s gross backpay below.

The General Counsel calculates that Membrino would have 
earned  gross  wages  in  the  amount  of  $199,285.90  had  he 
worked for Respondent during the backpay period.  To calcu-
late  that  figure,  the  General  Counsel  determined  the  average 
number of regular and overtime  hours that Membrino worked 
in the first three quarters of 2008 (444.6 regular and 61.1 over-
time  hours  per  quarter),  and  projected  that  Membrino  would 
have continued to work that amount of hours for each quarter 
during  the  backpay  period.33    (Tr.  27–28,  38–42,  44,  92;  GC 
Exhs.  1(k),  6,  27;  see  also  Casehandling  Manual,  Section 
10540.2 (describing the backpay formula based on the average
hours/earnings of the discriminatee before the unlawful action); 
see  also  FOF,  sec.  A  (noting  that  Membrino  initially  was  a 
salaried employee, but became an hourly employee in January 
2008).)  

Respondent  raises  three  primary  objections  to  the  General 
Counsel’s calculations, none of which hit the mark.  First, Re-
spondent implicitly questioned whether Membrino would have 
worked continuously for Respondent during the backpay peri-
od.34    (R.  Br.  at  54–57.)    As  noted  above,  I  do  not  find  that 
                                                          

33 I  do  not  find  merit  to  Respondent’s  argument  that  the  General 
Counsel should have deducted certain Federal holidays from each quar-
ter (instead of assuming that each quarter included 13 full workweeks).  
(R.  Br.  at  58–60.)    As  the  General  Counsel’s  compliance  officer  ob-
served,  no  adjustment  is  necessary  for  intervening  holidays  because 
those  nonwork  days  are  incorporated  into  the  average  hours  that 
Membrino worked in 2008.  (Tr. 41.)

34 I  note  that  Respondent  did  not  explicitly  proffer  an  alternative 
backpay formula (such as a formula based on the hours and earnings of 
comparable or replacement employees) that it believed would be more 
accurate than the formula that the General Counsel used.  I also note 
that during the compliance investigation, the General Counsel’s ability 
to consider alternative formulae for gross backpay was hampered by the 
fact  that  Respondent  only  provided  the  General  Counsel  with 
Membrino’s employee ledger, and not the ledgers of other drivers who 
worked for Respondent during the backpay period.  (Tr. 139–140; see 
also Tr. 35–36, 93–95 (noting that Respondent provided the employee 
ledgers  for  other  CDL  drivers  on  the  first  day  of  the  hearing  in  this 
matter, and that the General Counsel considered the additional materi-
als at that time and determined that the other drivers were not compara-
ble  employees  to  Membrino).)    In  any  event,  to  the  extent  that  Re-
spondent  suggested  that  the  General  Counsel  should  have  calculated 
backpay based on the hours worked by replacement employee R.S., I 
do not find that such a formula would be appropriate since employee 
R.S. only worked for Respondent during a portion of the backpay peri-
od (from September 2009 through December 2010—see FOF, sec/ E), 
and the evidentiary record does not show that Membrino’s work with 

12

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

argument to be persuasive.  The evidentiary record shows that 
after  Respondent  discharged  Membrino,  Respondent  hired  a 
series of new drivers to maintain its complement of drivers at 
five  or  higher  (where  it  would  have  been  had  Membrino  not 
been unlawfully discharged).  None of the hourly drivers that 
Respondent employed saw their average hours worked change 
significantly during the backpay period.  (FOF, sec. E; see also 
Tr. 28.)

Second,  Respondent  questioned  whether  Membrino  would 
have  continued  to  be  paid  at  the  same  hourly  wage  rate 
throughout the backpay period, or rather would have been ex-
pected to accept a pay cut during the backpay period (e.g., be-
cause  he  would  have  spent  a  fair  amount  of  time  driving  a 
dump truck, which only required a class B license).  (R. Br. at 
60.)  That argument, however, is undermined by the fact that: 
Respondent did  not  ask  Membrino to  accept  a pay  cut  before 
Membrino  was  discharged  in  2008,  even  though  Membrino 
primarily drove one of Respondent’s dump trucks from March 
2008  onward,  and  Respondent  obtained  pay  cuts  from  other 
employees in the same time period; and Respondent gave em-
ployee  R.S.  a  raise  in  October  2010  to  $22  per  hour  even 
though employee R.S. also primarily only drove a dump truck.  
(FOF, secs. A, E.)  Based on those facts, I infer that Respondent 
would have continued to pay Membrino his $22/hour rate dur-
ing  the  backpay  period  because  Respondent  valued  (among 
other  things)  the  fact  that  Membrino  had  a  good  track  record 
with the Company and had a class A CDL that enabled him to 
drive a variety of Respondent’s vehicles when needed.

Third, Respondent contends that the General Counsel should 
have calculated Membrino’s average hours in 2008 based on 39 
weeks of work, instead of 37.  (See R. Br. at 9–10.)  The Gen-
eral Counsel used the 37-week figure because it excluded a 2-
week period that Membrino did not work in July 2008 because 
he was on a vacation that the General Counsel determined was 
an extraordinary, nonrecurring event.  (Tr. 38–40, 62–69, 238–
239 (Membrino did not take a similar vacation after commenc-
ing work for Respondent in June 2007, or at any point during 
the backpay period); GC Exh. 6; see also Casehandling Manual, 
Section 10540.2 (explaining that calculations of average earn-
ings  or  hours  generally  should  exclude  time  periods  in  which 
extraordinary,  nonrecurring  events  temporarily  affect  earn-
ings/hours).)  Although Respondent contests the General Coun-
sel’s  decision  to  exclude  that  2-week  period,  I  find  that  the 
evidentiary record supports that General Counsel’s determina-
tion  that  the  2-week  vacation  was  essentially  an  anomaly  be-
cause there is no evidence that  Membrino ever took a similar 
vacation before or during the backpay period.  It was therefore 
reasonable  for  the  General  Counsel  to  exclude  that  2-week 
vacation  from  its calculation  of  the  number  of  weeks  that 
Membrino worked before he was discharged in 2008.35
                                                                                            
Respondent (had he not been discharged unlawfully) would have been 
limited to the period of time that employee R.S. worked.  

35 During  the  trial, Respondent  presented  evidence  that  established 
that Membrino’s CDL was suspended from August 11 to October 24, 
2008, while Membrino worked for Respondent.  There is no evidence, 
however,  that  Respondent  learned,  or  would  have  learned,  about  this 
issue with Membrino’s CDL during the backpay period.  Perhaps more 
important, there is no evidence that Respondent would have terminated 

In sum, I credit the General Counsel’s gross backpay calcu-
lation and the facts in the evidentiary record (some of which are 
referenced above) on which the General Counsel’s calculation 
is  based.    The  General  Counsel  used  a  reasonable  formula  to 
calculate  what  Membrino  would  have  earned  had  Respondent 
not  discharged  him  unlawfully,  and  thus  I  have  accepted  the 
General Counsel’s calculation that Membrino’s gross backpay 
figure is $199,285.90.

C. Membrino’s Interim Earnings and Efforts 

to Mitigate Backpay

With the gross backpay figure established, the burden shifts 
to Respondent to establish facts that negate or mitigate its lia-
bility,  with  the  caveat  that  any  uncertainty  will  be  resolved 
against Respondent, since its unlawful action against Membrino 
caused the uncertainty.

As a preliminary matter, the General Counsel acknowledges 
that Membrino worked six jobs during the backpay period that 
produced interim earnings from the second quarter of 2010 to 
the end of the backpay period.36  (FOF, sec. D.)  Based on those 
                                                                                            
Membrino  had  it  learned  that  Membrino’s  CDL  was  suspended.    In-
stead,  it  is  clear  that  Respondent  at  most  would  have  suspended 
Membrino until he cleared up the problems with his license.  (FOF, sec. 
A.)  Thus, there is no basis for terminating backpay based on the fact 
that Membrino worked for Respondent while he had a suspended CDL.  
See First Transit, Inc., 350 NLRB 825, 829 (2007) (explaining that if 
an employer learns that an employee engaged in misconduct that would 
have  caused  the  employer  to  discharge  any  employee,  then  reinstate-
ment is not available and backpay is terminated as of the day that the 
employer  learned of the misconduct); id. (finding that employee mis-
conduct  that  the  employer  discovered  would  not  change  the  backpay 
award  because  the  employer  learned  of  the  misconduct  after  the 
backpay period ended).

I do not find that Membrino’s CDL suspension in 2008 affects the 
General Counsel’s gross backpay calculation, because that calculation 
is  based  on  a  reasonable  projection  of  the  number  of  hours  that 
Membrino  would  have  worked  for  Respondent  during  the  backpay 
period  (using  the  average  hours  that  Membrino  actually  worked  for 
Respondent  in  2008,  irrespective  of  any  misconduct  that  Respondent 
did not know about).  To the extent, however, that Membrino’s CDL
was suspended during the backpay period, I address how those suspen-
sions affect the net backpay figure later in this decision.

36 The evidentiary record does not support a finding that Membrino 
willfully  concealed  other  interim  earnings  (such  as  earnings  from  al-
leged  self-employment)  during  the  backpay  period.    Membrino  only 
had  earnings  from  the  six  jobs  discussed  in  the  findings  of  fact;  alt-
hough  Membrino  contemplated  opening  an  auto  sales  business  (Cee-
Moni Auto) during the backpay period, he abandoned the idea and did 
not earn any money from it.  Further, although Membrino stated on job 
applications 
that  he  worked  for  “Membrino  Trucking”  and/or 
“Membrino Delivery Service” during the backpay period, the eviden-
tiary record  establishes that those job entries on Membrino’s applica-
tions were false (Membrino listed them with the hope that the lack of 
“gaps”  in  his  job history  would  increase  his  chances  of  being  hired).  
(FOF, secs. C(1), D.)

The evidentiary record also does not support Respondent’s argument 
that  Membrino  willfully  failed  to  report  his  earnings  from  Portable 
Storage and Reddy Ice to the Board.  (See R. Br. at 84–85.)  Although 
Membrino did not report those jobs to the Board on his quarterly search 
for work reports (see R. Exh. 1), Respondent did not demonstrate, and 
thus  I  do  not  find,  that  Membrino’s  failure  to  report  those  jobs  was 
willful  or  part  of  a  scheme  for  unjustified  personal  gain.    See 

PESSOA CONSTRUCTION CO.

quarterly  interim  earnings,  and  on  the  fact  that  Membrino’s 
interim earnings in the first quarter of 2013 exceeded his gross 
backpay for that quarter (meaning that no net backpay is owed 
for  that  quarter),  the  General  Counsel  calculated  the  total  net 
backpay figure as $107,929.  (GC Exh. 1(k).)  I now turn to the 
question of whether Respondent demonstrated (based on any of 
the theories that it proffered) that the net backpay figure should 
be reduced to an amount lower than that proposed by the Gen-
eral Counsel.

1. Was Membrino unavailable to work due to 

health-related reasons?

The  record  is  clear  that  on  November  3,  2008,  Membrino 
experienced chest pain and numbness in his arms that led to an 
overnight  hospital  stay  that  included  a  coronary  angiography 
and angioplasty procedure to address a blockage in one of his 
coronary arteries.  (FOF, sec. C(2).)  The parties disagree, how-
ever,  about how  long  Membrino  was  unavailable  to  work  be-
cause  of  that  procedure  and  the  underlying  medical  problems 
that led to it.  The General Counsel maintains that Membrino 
was  only  unavailable  to  work  from  November  3–28,  2008, 
based  on Membrino  representations  on  one  of  his  “search  for 
work” reports to the Board.  (GC Br. at 30; FOF, sec. C(2) (not-
ing  that  Membrino  reported  that  he  was  unavailable  to  work 
from November 3–25, 2008, due to illness).)   Respondent, by 
contrast,  maintains  that  Membrino  was  unavailable  from  No-
vember  3,  2008,  to April  23,  2010  (the  day  that  Membrino 
passed  his  DOT  physical  before  starting  his  first  interim  job 
with Portable Storage).  (R. Br. at 78; see also FOF, sec. D(1).)  
To resolve this dispute, I first address what medical conditions 
Membrino  encountered  in November  2008,  and  then  address 
the extent to which those conditions rendered Membrino una-
vailable to work.

a. What medical conditions did Membrino have in 

November 2008?

Initially,  the  parties  disagree  about  what  actually  befell 
Membrino  in  November  2008.    Although  Respondent  seizes 
upon Membrino’s own characterizations of what led to his hos-
pital stay (a  “heart attack” or a  coronary bypass procedure), I 
did  not  credit  those  descriptions  because  Membrino  is  not  a 
medical  professional  and  his  descriptions are  not  consistent 
with the medical records that hospital personnel prepared at the 
time  of  Membrino’s  hospital  stay.    Instead,  as  noted  above,  I 
found that Membrino was diagnosed with angina pectoris (un-
stable),  hypertension  (malignant), 
ischemic  heart  disease 
(acute), and obesity, and I further found that medical personnel 
treated  those  conditions  by:  (a)  performing  a  coronary  angi-
ography  and  angioplasty,  and  placing  a  stent  in  one  of 
                                                                                            
Grosvenor Resort, 350 NLRB 1197, 1198, 1236–1237 (2007) (discuss-
ing American Navigation Co., 268 NLRB 426 (1983), and explaining 
that  a  showing  of  willful  perfidy  and  deception  is  required  to  justify 
reducing a backpay award because of earnings that were not reported to 
the Board).   To the contrary, Membrino was generally diligent in re-
porting his interim employment, and stood little to gain in concealing 
the  brief  periods  that  he  worked  for  Portable  Storage  and  Reddy  Ice 
(which produced interim earnings of $490 and $6,426.83, respectively).  
I  therefore  deny  Respondent’s  request  that  I  reduce  Membrino’s 
backpay award under this theory.       

Membrino’s coronary arteries; and (b) prescribing medication.  
(FOF. sec. C(2), (4).)

b. How long was Membrino unavailable to work due to

his November 2008 medical problems?

The parties agree, and I find, that the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety  Administration  (FMCSA)  of  the  U.S.  Department  of 
Transportation has issued regulations that establish the physical 
qualifications and medical examinations that an individual must 
satisfy to drive a commercial vehicle safely.  Generally speak-
ing, to operate a commercial motor vehicle, an individual must 
meet  the  physical  qualification  requirements  set  forth  in  the 
regulations  (unless  certain  exceptions  apply),  and  also  must 
pass  a  medical  examination  (the  “DOT  physical”  discussed 
above in the findings of fact) performed by a medical examiner 
listed on the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners.  
See  49  CFR  §  391.41  (discussing  physical  qualifications  for 
drivers); 49 CFR § 391.43 (discussing the medical examination 
require-ment); see also 49 CFR § 391.45(b)(1), (c) (explaining 
that a driver must complete a medical examination if he or she 
has not been certified within the preceding 24 months, or if the 
driver’s  ability  to  perform  his  or  her  normal  duties  has  been 
impaired by a physical or mental injury or disease); see also R. 
Exh.  21  (the  General  Counsel’s  compliance  officer  acknowl-
edged that Membrino needed to complete a medical examina-
tion to operate a commercial vehicle)).   

that  Membrino 

Respondent  contends 

ineligible  for 
backpay  from  November  3,  2008,  to  April  23,  2010,  because 
Membrino  did  not  take  or  pass  a  DOT  physical
in  that 
timeframe to establish that he could operate a commercial mo-
tor vehicle safely after his November 2008 hospital stay.37  (R. 
                                                          

is 

37

In  connection  with  this  argument,  Respondent  implies  that 
Membrino  had  a  medical  condition  that  precluded  him  from  being 
physically qualified to drive under FMCSA regulations.  (See R. Br. at 
73.)    Specifically,  Respondent  cited  to  49  CFR  §  391.41(b),  which 
states, in pertinent part, that:

(b)    A  person  is  physically  qualified  to  drive  a  commercial  motor 

vehicle if that person

. . . .
(4) Has no current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, or any other cardiovascu-
lar disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, 
collapse, or congestive cardiac failure.

. . . .

(6) Has no current clinical diagnosis of high blood pressure likely to 
interfere  with  his/her  ability  to  operate  a  commercial  motor  vehicle 
safely

. . . .

(7) Has no established medical history or clinical diagnosis of rheu-
matic, arthritic, orthopedic, muscular, neuromuscular, or vascular dis-
ease which interferes with his/her ability to control and operate a com-
mercial motor vehicle safely

The  evidentiary  record,  however,  does  not  show  that  any  medical 
professional  (much  less  a  medical  examiner  who  performed  a  DOT 
physical) determined that Membrino: has a current clinical diagnosis of 

14

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

Br. at 78.)  That argument fails because the evidentiary record 
shows that neither Respondent nor potential interim employers 
(such  as  Portable  Storage  and  Aggregate)  required  Membrino 
to present a current DOT card as a precondition to considering 
him  for  vacant  CDL  positions.    Instead,  potential  employers 
allowed Membrino to apply for vacant CDL positions, and then 
sent him for a DOT physical only as a final step to fulfill before 
starting work.  Membrino complied with that procedure when 
asked to do so, and passed his DOT physicals when they were 
required.  (FOF, sec. D(1)–(2).)  Since there is no evidence of a 
period  of  time  where  Membrino  would not  have  been  able  to 
pass a DOT physical if requested (apart from November 3–28, 
2008, for which the General Counsel requested no backpay due 
to Membrino’s illness), I reject Respondent’s request to toll the 
backpay period on that basis.38

c. Membrino’s August 2010 suspension for having an

expired DOT card

Notwithstanding  my  analysis  above,  I  do  find  that  the 
backpay period should be tolled from August 30 through Sep-
tember  3,  2010, because  Membrino  allowed  his  DOT  card  to 
expire while he was employed by  Aggregate.  (See FOF, sec.
D(2).)    Although  Aggregate  only  suspended  Membrino  for  2
days for his failure to obtain a new DOT card, I do not find it 
equitable to require Respondent to pay Membrino backpay for a 
time  period  when  FMCSA  regulations  prohibited  Membrino 
from  working  because  his  DOT  card  was  expired.39    At  the 
                                                                                            
angina pectoris or cardiovascular disease that is accompanied by syn-
cope,  dyspnea,  collapse  or  congestive  cardiac  failure;  or 
that 
Membrino’s high blood pressure or vascular disease interferes with his 
ability to control and operate a motor vehicle safely.   (See  FOF, sec. 
C(2)  (noting  that  Washington  Adventist  Hospital  personnel  only  di-
rected  Membrino  to  refrain  from  driving  for  2  days),  C(4),  D(1)–(2); 
see also 49 CFR § 391.43 (noting that DOT medical examiners must 
evaluate  the  driver’s  heart  and  blood  pressure,  and  note  whether  any 
history of cardiovascular disease is accompanied by syncope, dyspnea 
or collapse).) 

38 Respondent attempted to draw support from the ALJ’s decision in 
First Transit, Inc., 352 NLRB 896 (2008), but that decision is distin-
guishable.    In  First  Transit,  the  ALJ  terminated  the  discriminatee’s 
backpay period as of the date that the discriminatee suffered a stroke.  
The record in that case, however, showed that the discriminatee avoid-
ed obtaining any type of medical certification that he could drive de-
spite  suffering  a  stroke,  and  also  showed  that  the  discriminatee  still 
displayed stroke-related limitations at the time of trial.  Id. at 901–902 
(noting 
law  and  federal  regulations,  the 
discriminatee was subject to being evaluated to determine whether he 
remained competent to drive a motor vehicle after his stroke, but con-
cealed  his  medical  condition  from  state  and  federal  authorities);  see 
also id. at 896 fn. 2 (the parties did not appeal this aspect of the ALJ’s 
decision).  Membrino did not engage in that type of misconduct here—
instead, he submitted to DOT physicals when requested as a precursor 
to starting a new job, and passed those physicals.

39 I have considered the fact that Respondent may have unwittingly 
allowed  Membrino  to  drive  with  an  expired  DOT  card  because  Re-
spondent did not check DOT cards to ensure that they were current and 
valid.    That  fact  does  not  determine  the  outcome  here,  however,  be-
cause  the  fact  remains  that,  consistent  with  FMCSA  regulations,  Re-
spondent  expected  its  drivers  to  maintain  current  DOT  cards.    (See 
FOF, sec. D(2).)  Since Respondent expected its drivers to comply with 
FMCSA  regulations  regarding  DOT  cards  (and  the  medical  examina-

same time, however, I will not grant Respondent an offset for 
any  interim  earnings  that  Membrino  accrued  from  August  30 
through  September 3,  2010,  because  Respondent  should  not 
receive a windfall offset for earnings that Membrino brought in 
while the backpay period was tolled.

2. Should the backpay period be tolled when 

Membrino’s CDL was suspended?

As  one  would  expect,  FMCSA  regulations  prohibit  CDL 
drivers  who  have  been  “disqualified”  from  operating  a  com-
mercial motor vehicle.  49 CFR § 391.15(a).  Regarding CDL 
drivers who have been disqualified because they have lost their 
driving privileges, the FMCSA has stated as follows:

A driver is disqualified for the duration of the driver’s loss of 
his/her  privilege  to  operate  a  commercial  motor  vehicle  on 
public highways, either temporarily or permanently, by reason 
of the revocation, suspension, withdrawal, or denial of an op-
erator’s  license, permit,  or  privilege,  until  that  operator’s  li-
cense, permit, or privilege is restored by the authority that re-
voked, suspended, withdrew, or denied it.

49 CFR § 391.15(b)(1).

Relying  on  these  FMCSA  regulations,  Respondent  argues 
that the backpay period should be tolled during each period of 
time  when  Membrino’s  CDL  was  suspended.    I  find  merit  to 
Respondent’s argument.  Simply put, Membrino had an obliga-
tion to maintain a current and valid CDL to operate a commer-
cial motor vehicle.  Despite that obligation, Membrino repeat-
edly  failed  to  respond  to  notices  from  the  Maryland  District 
Court  that  he  risked  having  his  CDL  suspended  (e.g.,  due  to 
failing to pay a fine, or failing to pay child support), and thus 
repeatedly  allowed  that  court  to  suspend  his  CDL  for  weeks 
(and  sometimes  months)  at  a  time.40    Indeed,  as  noted  in  the 
findings  of  fact,  Membrino’s  CDL  was  suspended  during  the 
backpay period at the following times:
                                                                                            
tions  that  come  with  them),  I  find  that  Respondent  does  not  owe 
backpay during periods when FMCSA regulations made it unlawful for 
Membrino to work as a CDL driver because his DOT card expired. 

I emphasize that Membrino allowing his DOT card to expire when 
he was gainfully employed as a CDL driver is a different circumstance 
than Membrino applying for jobs without a valid DOT card in-hand (an 
issue  that  I  discussed  in  sec.  1(b),  above).    Nothing  in  the  FMCSA 
required Membrino to pass a DOT physical as a precondition to apply-
ing for CDL jobs.

40 There was some evidence presented at trial that Membrino did not 
receive mail in a timely manner (or consistently) because he stayed in a 
variety of locations and used the home addresses of certain relatives as 
his mailing addresses.  (See, e.g., Tr. 388–390.)  Regardless, I find that 
Membrino  was  obligated  to  ensure  that  he  received  correspondence 
(and particularly correspondence from courts of law) in a timely man-
ner, and I further find that Membrino is charged with any adverse con-
sequences (including CDL suspensions) that resulted from his failure to 
provide the courts with a reliable mailing address.

As stated in the FMCSA regulations, I find that Membrino
was disqualified from working as a CDL driver during each of 
the time periods when his CDL was suspended.  I also find that 
Membrino is not eligible for backpay for the times that his CDL 
was suspended—the record is clear that Respondent would not 
have  allowed  Membrino  to  work  either  as  a  driver  or  in  a 
nondriving  capacity  while  his  CDL  was  suspended  (see  FOF, 
sec.  A),  and  thus  it  follows  that  Respondent  does  not  owe 
backpay  for  periods  that  Membrino  had  a  suspended  CDL.42  
See  Cliffstar Transportation  Co.,  311  NLRB  152,  157  (1993) 
(finding that because the discriminatee was unavailable to work 
as  a  driver  because  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended,  and 
because the evidentiary record did not show that the employer 
was obligated to offer the discriminatee some type of alterna-
tive  employment  when  the  discriminatee  could  not  drive,  the 
discriminatee was not eligible for backpay for the period when 
his license was suspended); see also NLRB v. Browne, 890 F.2d 
605,  608–609  (2d Cir.  1989)  (finding  that  a  discriminatee 
whose driver’s license  was suspended because he did not pay 
traffic summonses or insure his vehicle voluntarily forfeited not 
only his driving privileges, but also his eligibility for backpay 
at  a  driver’s  rate).    To  the  extent  that  Membrino  had  interim 
earnings during periods when he had a suspended CDL, I will 
not  give  Respondent  an  offset  for  those  earnings  because  to 
grant  an  offset  under  those  circumstances  would  afford  Re-
spondent an unnecessary windfall.

3. Would Respondent have laid off Membrino during 

the backpay period?

As noted above, I resolved this issue when I decided to grant 
the General Counsel’s motion for partial summary judgment, as 
well  as  the  General  Counsel’s  motion  to  strike.    However,  in 
the interest of making a complete record, I have analyzed the 
                                                          

41 I do not accept Respondent’s calculations of the number of days 
that  Membrino  was  unavailable  to  work  due  to  CDL  suspensions.  
Respondent included Saturdays in its count of “unavailable” days (see 
R. Br. at 71), but there is no basis in the evidentiary record for me to 
find that Membrino’s workweek with Respondent customarily included 
Saturdays (or Sundays).  

42 The  General  Counsel’s  compliance  officer  candidly  admitted  at 
trial that Membrino would not be entitled to backpay for periods that 
his CDL was suspended if Respondent had a practice of prohibiting its 
drivers  from  working  under  those  circumstances.    (Tr.  80–81.)    The 
evidentiary  record  establishes  that  the  scenario  that  the  compliance 
officer identified applies in this case.  (See FOF, sec. A.)

factual  and  legal  merits  of  Respondent’s  layoff  argument  be-
low.

The Board has held that a respondent may limit its backpay 
liability by  showing that an employee  who  was discharged or 
laid off for unlawful reasons would have been laid off for law-
ful  reasons  at  a  later  date.    However,  the  respondent  has  the 
burden of proving with certainty when the discriminatee would 
have been laid off had there been no discrimination.  Weldun 
International, Inc., 340 NLRB 666, 674 (2003).  

In  this  case,  Respondent  suggests  that  the  backpay  period 
should  end  on  an  unspecified  date  in  fall  2008  because  Re-
spondent would have laid off Membrino for legitimate reasons 
(lack of work due to the poor economy) at that time.  (See R. 
Br.  at  14,  54–57.)    I  find  that  Respondent  failed  to  meet  its 
burden  in  proving  that  theory.    Although  Respondent  made 
general  points  about  the  poor  economy  and  its  effect  on  Re-
spondent’s  amount  of  work,  it  did  not  establish  that  it  would 
have laid off Membrino due to lack of work, or establish pre-
cisely when that layoff would have occurred.  Instead, contrary 
to Respondent’s theory, the evidentiary record shows that Re-
spondent  retained  Membrino  despite  laying  off  a  significant 
number of employees in 2008, and further shows that Respond-
ent hired additional CDL drivers shortly after Membrino’s dis-
charge to generally maintain its complement of drivers at five 
or  higher  (where  it  would have  been  had  Membrino  not been 
discharged  unlawfully).    (FOF,  sec.  E.)    In  light  of  that  evi-
dence, I find that there is no basis for me to conclude that Re-
spondent  would  have  laid  off  Membrino  before  February  8, 
2013 (the date that Respondent offered to reinstate Membrino).

4. Was Membrino’s job search adequate?

“Longstanding remedial principles establish that backpay is 
not available to a discriminatee who has failed to seek interim 
employment and thus incurred a willful loss of earnings.”  St. 
George  Warehouse,  351  NLRB  at  963. 
  Thus,  “[a] 
discriminatee must make reasonable efforts during the backpay 
period to seek and hold interim employment.  This is known as 
the  discriminatee’s  obligation  to  mitigate.    A  discriminatee  is 
not due backpay for any period within the backpay period dur-
ing which it is determined that he or she failed to make a rea-
sonable effort to mitigate[.]”  Id. (quoting NLRB Casehandling 
Manual, Part Three, Compliance Sec. 10558.1).

To  assert,  as  a  defense  to  backpay  liability,  that  a 
discriminatee  conducted  an  inadequate  job  search  and  thus 
willfully failed to mitigate, a respondent has the initial burden 
of  presenting  evidence  showing  that  there  were  suitable  and 
substantially equivalent jobs available in the relevant geograph-
ic area for an individual with the discriminatee’s qualifications.  
St  George  Warehouse,  351  NLRB  at  963–964.    The  burden 
then shifts to the General Counsel to present evidence concern-
ing the discriminatee’s job search.  Once the General Counsel 
satisfies that burden of production, the respondent has the ulti-
mate burden of proving that the discriminatee did not mitigate 
damages  by  using  reasonable  diligence  in  seeking  alternate 
employment.  Id. at 964.  Notably, the test for mitigation is not 
measured by a discriminatee’s success in gaining employment, 
but rather by the efforts made to seek work.  Lorge School, 355 
NLRB No. 94, slip op. at 3 (2010); see also id. at 3–4 (explain-

16

DECISIONS OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD

ing that the reasonableness of a discriminatee’s search for work 
should  be  evaluated  in  light  of  all  of  the  circumstances,  and 
over the backpay period as a whole).  

Turning,  then,  to  the  facts  at  hand,  I  find  that  Respondent 
met  its  initial  burden  regarding  the  adequacy  of  Membrino’s 
search  for  work  because  Membrino  admitted  that  there  were 
(and  that  he  applied  for)  suitable  and  substantially  equivalent 
CDL driver positions available in the relevant geographic area 
during the backpay period.  I also find that the General Counsel 
met  its  burden  to  produce  evidence  about  Membrino’s  job 
search,  because  Membrino  testified  credibly  and  extensively 
about: his efforts to find alternate employment; the job search 
requirements that he had to meet to qualify for unemployment 
compensation  in  the  State  of  Maryland  (at  least  until  March 
2010,  when  Membrino  exhausted  his  unemployment  bene-
fits);43 the  quarterly  reports  that  he (Membrino)  submitted  to 
the General Counsel (and that were admitted into evidence) to 
document some of the numerous job openings that he pursued 
during the backpay period;44 and, of course, the six jobs that he 
actually obtained during the backpay period (the last of which 
Membrino has held since August 2011).  (FOF, secs. C(1), D.) 
Given the considerable evidence about Membrino’s efforts to 
find work throughout the backpay period, Respondent fell well 
short of meeting its ultimate burden of proving that Membrino 
did  not  use  reasonable  diligence  in  seeking  alternate  employ-
ment. 
  Although  Respondent  correctly  pointed  out  that 
Membrino  made  false  statements  on  some  of  his  job  applica-
tions  (see  R.  Br.  at  49–53),  Respondent  did  not  present  any 
evidence that those false statements prevented Membrino from 
obtaining or retaining employment during the backpay period.  
Similarly,  Respondent  failed  to  show  that  Membrino’s  job 
search  was  unreasonably  narrow  or  limited  in  any  respect.  
Accordingly, I reject Respondent’s argument that Membrino’s 
job search was inadequate, and decline to adjust Respondent’s 
backpay liability on that basis.
                                                          

43 The Board has held that the receipt of unemployment compensa-
tion under the applicable eligibility rules for such benefits constitutes 
prima  facie  evidence  of  a  reasonable  search  for  interim  employment.  
Taylor Machine Products, Inc., 338 NLRB 831, 832 (2003), enfd. 98 
Fed.  Appx.  424  (6th  Cir.  2004).    In  its  posttrial  brief  at  61–63,  Re-
spondent makes much of the fact that Membrino did not begin receiv-
ing  unemployment  benefits  until  February  2009  (approximately  4 
months into the backpay period), but other evidence in the record (in-
cluding Membrino’s testimony and the reports that he submitted to the 
Board  about his  efforts  to  find  work)  establishes  that Membrino  dili-
gently searched for work between October 2008 and February 2009.  

44 Respondent faults Membrino for not having the notebook that he 
used to keep track of job inquiries and applications during the backpay 
period.    I  do  not  find  that  issue  to  warrant  any  adjustment  to 
Membrino’s  backpay  award.    Membrino  credibly  explained  that  the 
notebook was stolen (along with other items) when someone broke in 
to Membrino’s car.  And, in any event, discriminatees do not have an 
obligation  to  keep  original  documentation  of  their  job  searches,  and 
discriminatees  are  not  disqualified  from  backpay  because  of  poor 
recordkeeping.  Lorge School, 355 NLRB No. 94, slip op. at 4 & fn. 6.

5. Did Membrino unreasonably quit any 

interim jobs?

It  is  well  established  that  when  a  discriminatee  voluntarily 
quits interim employment, the burden shifts from the respond-
ent to the General Counsel to show that the decision to quit was 
reasonable.  First Transit, Inc., 350 NLRB 825, 826 (2007).  If 
the decision to quit was unreasonable, then the respondent may 
(depending  on  what  happened  during  the  rest  of  the  backpay 
period) be entitled to an offset for the interim earnings that the 
discriminatee would have earned had he or she not quit the job 
in question.  Id. at 827; see also Grosvenor Resort, 350 NLRB 
1197, 1201 (2007).

Respondent asserts that the backpay figure should be adjust-
ed because Membrino voluntarily quit two jobs in 2011: A, D 
& C Management Company; and Reddy Ice.  (R. Br. at 78–81.)  
Regarding  Membrino’s  departure  from  A,  D  &  C,  Respond-
ent’s  argument  fails  because  Membrino  immediately  began 
working  for Reddy Ice without a break in service, and Reddy 
Ice  provided  Membrino  with  more  work  hours.    (FOF,  sec. 
D(5)–(6).)    The  General  Counsel  therefore  established  that 
Membrino’s decision to quit his position at A, D & C was rea-
sonable.

As  for  Membrino’s  departure  from  Reddy  Ice,  the  record 
shows that Membrino voluntarily left his position at that com-
pany because Reddy Ice made Membrino a standby driver once 
it learned that Membrino would be leaving the company to start 
a  new  job  at  WSSC.    Thus,  rather  than  continue  working  at 
Reddy Ice in a standby driver capacity with no guarantee that 
he would be assigned work each day, Membrino quit his posi-
tion at Reddy Ice and remained out of work for 1.5 weeks until 
he began working at WSSC.  (FOF, sec. D(6).)  

Given those circumstances, I  find that the General Counsel 
also demonstrated that Membrino’s decision to quit his standby 
driver position at Reddy Ice was reasonable.  Membrino had a 
new  job  with  WSSC  already  in  hand  at  the  time,  and  Reddy 
Ice’s decision to make Membrino a standby driver meant that 
Membrino  would  be  assigned  little,  if  any,  work  had  he  re-
mained  with  Reddy  Ice  for  the  1.5  week  period  in  question.  
Since the standby driver position at Reddy Ice was not compa-
rable to the full-time CDL driver position that Membrino’s held 
with  Respondent,  Membrino  was  not  obligated  to  continue 
working at Reddy Ice, and did not incur a willful loss of earn-
ings  when  he  decided  to  quit  (until  his  new  job  with  WSSC 
began  1.5  weeks  later).  See Glover  Bottled  Gas  Corp.,  313 
NLRB 43, 43 (1993) (finding no willful loss of earnings when a 
discriminatee  quit  a  position  that  offered  only  sporadic  em-
ployment and moved to another State where he found work 2 
weeks after moving), enfd. 47 F.3d 1230 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. 
denied 516 U.S. 816 (1995).  I therefore decline to adjust the 
backpay figure based on the occasions where Membrino volun-
tarily quit interim employment.

6. Was Membrino terminated from any interim jobs 

due to willful misconduct?

The  Board  consistently  has  held  that  a  discriminatee’s  dis-
charge from interim employment, without more, is not enough 
to constitute willful loss of employment.  Instead, a respondent 
must  show  deliberate  or  gross  misconduct  on  the  part  of  the 

PESSOA CONSTRUCTION CO.

17

discharged discriminatee to establish a willful loss of employ-
ment,  and  hence,  a  failure  to  mitigate.    Ryder  System,  302 
NLRB  608,  610  (1991)  (explaining  willful  misconduct  would 
include, for example, an offense on the job that involved moral 
turpitude, or misconduct that was so outrageous as to suggest 
that the discriminatee was courting discharge), enfd. 983 F.2d 
705 (6th Cir. 1993).

Respondent  asserts  that  Membrino  engaged  in  willful  mis-
conduct that led to his discharge from three jobs: Portable Stor-
age;  Aggregate Industries; and Cylos, Inc.  (R. Br. at 81–82.)  
The evidentiary record does not support Respondent’s conten-
tion.    Regarding  Portable  Storage,  I  found  that  the  company 
ended Membrino’s employment because it reevaluated its needs 
and decided it did not need a full-time driver to work in north-
ern  Virginia.    I  did  not  credit  the  testimony  that  Respondent 
presented  that  Membrino  voluntarily  stopped  showing  up  for 
work at Portable Storage because the witness who offered that 
testimony  lacked  personal  knowledge  about  how  Membrino’s 
employment  with  the  company  ended,  and  the  witness’  testi-
mony was not corroborated by any contemporaneous business 
records.  (FOF, sec. D(1).)  Membrino’s loss of employment at 
Portable  Storage  because  the  company  reassessed  its  staffing 
needs  falls  well  short  of  a  “willful  loss  of  employment”  that 
would warrant terminating the backpay period.

As  for  Aggregate  and  Cylos,  the  evidentiary  record  shows 
that  those  companies  discharged  Membrino  for  poor  job  per-
formance.    Specifically,  Aggregate  discharged  Membrino  be-
cause he violated certain work rules and procedures (e.g., caus-
ing truck damage on one occasion, not keeping his DOT card 
current,  and  not  following  certain  procedures  to  maintain  his 
truck and mix concrete properly) over a 6-month period, lead-
ing Aggregate to conclude that he was not meeting the essential 
functions of his job.  (FOF, sec. D(2).)  Cylos, meanwhile, dis-
charged  Membrino  because  he  left  water  in  the  truck  lines 
overnight  (albeit  due  to  an  apparent  miscommunication  with 
the  company’s  mechanic),  and  consequently  the  truck  water 
lines  froze  and  the  turnoff  valve  cracked.    (FOF,  sec.  D(3).)  
Thus,  although  the  facts  show  that  Membrino’s  job  perfor-
mance at Aggregate and Cylos was subpar at times, the facts do 
not  show  that  Membrino  engaged  in  willful  misconduct  that 
would  warrant  terminating  the  backpay  period  based  on  his 
discharges from those companies.45  
                                                          

45 I  also  reject  Respondent’s  argument  that  the  backpay  period 
should be limited because Membrino made false statements on his job 
applications to various companies.  (See R. Br. at 82–84; see also FOF, 
sec. D(1)–(2), (6)–(7) (describing false statements made in Membrino’s 
job applications to Portable Storage, Aggregate, Cylos, Reddy-Ice, and 
WSSC).)  As previously noted, there is no evidence that any company 
refused  to  hire,  or  discharged,  Membrino  because  of  any  false  state-
ments that he made on his job applications.  Nor is there any evidence 
that  Respondent  would  not have  hired,  or  would  have  discharged, 
Membrino  because  of  the  false  statements.    Further,  I  credited 
Membrino’s  explanation  that he  made  the  false  statements  on  his job 
applications because he was desperate to find employment.  While I do 
not condone Membrino’s decision to make the false statements, I find 
that the false statements do not constitute willful misconduct that would 
warrant limiting the backpay period.  See First Transit, Inc., 350 NLRB 
at 829 fn. 24 (although the Board did not condone the discriminatee’s 
untruthful  statements  at  trial  and  in  her  application  for  employment 

D. Net Backpay

In sum, I find that Membrino is entitled to backpay for the 
entire  backpay  period,  with  the  exception  of  the  following 
times  where  I  determined  that  the  backpay  period  should  be 
tolled:46

April 9–27, 2009;
August 30–December 2, 2010;
May 31– uly 11, 2011;
September 27, 2011–March 1, 2012; and 
December 12, 2012–January 30, 2013.

(Analysis,  sec.  C(1)(c),  (2).)   Taking  those dates  into  account 
(by deducting 0.2 from the relevant 13-week quarter for every 
weekday  that  Membrino  was  unavailable  to  work),47 I  have 
determined that Membrino is owed $95,046.07 in net backpay, 
as indicated in the following chart:

with the respondent, the Board still allowed the normal backpay reme-
dy because there was no evidence that the respondent would not have 
hired, or would have discharged, the discriminatee because of the un-
truthful statements).

46 Most  of  these  tolling  periods  correspond  to  times  when 
Membrino’s  CDL  was  suspended.    My  decision  to  toll  the  backpay 
period from August 30 to September 3, 2010, corresponds to two rea-
sons  why  Membrino  was  unavailable  to  work—specifically,  that  his 
CDL  was  suspended  and his  DOT  card  was  expired.    (Analysis,  sec. 
C(1)(c), (2).)

47 The  General  Counsel  used  a  similar  method  to  account  for 
Membrino’s unavailability in November 2008.  (Tr. 42–43.)  I find that 
method  to  be  reasonable,  and  do  not  accept  the  convoluted  alternate 
method  that  Respondent  proposed  in  its  posttrial  brief  at  71–72  be-
cause,  among  other  shortcomings,  Respondent  docked  Membrino’s 
backpay  for  “unavailability”  on  weekends  when  there  is  no  evidence 
that Membrino customarily worked weekends when he was employed 
by Respondent.

48 I deducted 12 days (2.4 weeks) from the second quarter of 2009 
because the backpay period was tolled from April 9–27, 2009 (the final 
day of the period counts as a working day because Membrino’s CDL 
suspension was lifted that day).  Gross backpay = (10.6 weeks x regular 
hours at $22/hour) + (10.6 weeks x overtime hours at $33/hour).

49 I deducted 24 days (4.8 weeks) from the third quarter of 2010 be-
cause the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from August 30 to 
September 30, 2010. Interim earnings for that quarter were prorated at a 
8.2  week/13  week  ratio  to  avoid  giving  Respondent  an  unwarranted 
offset for interim earnings that accrued while the backpay period was 
tolled.

50 I deducted 44 days (8.8 weeks) from the fourth quarter of 2010 
because the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from October 1 to 
December 2, 2010.  Interim earnings for that quarter were prorated at a 
4.2 week/13 week ratio.

Conclusion

Based  on  the  findings  and  analysis  set  forth  above,  and  on 
the  entire  record,  I  issue  the  following  recommended  supple-
mental

ORDER

Respondent,  Pessoa  Construction  Company,  Fairmont 
Heights, Maryland, its officers, agents, successors, and assigns, 
shall make whole discriminatee William Membrino by paying 
him  $95,046.07  in  net  backpay,  plus  interest at  the rate  pre-
scribed  in  New  Horizons  for  the  Retarded,  283  NLRB  1173 
(1987),  compounded  daily  as  prescribed  in  Kentucky  River 
Medical Center, 356 NLRB No. 8 (2010), accrued to the date 
of payment, and minus tax withholding required by Federal and 
State law.57

Dated, Washington, D.C.  December 24, 2013

                                                          

51 I deducted 23 days (4.6 weeks) from the second quarter of 2011 
because the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from May 31 to 
June 30, 2011.  Interim earnings for that quarter were prorated at a 8.4 
week/13 week ratio.

52 I deducted 10 days (2 weeks) from the third quarter of 2011 be-
cause the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from July 1–11 and 
September 27–30, 2011.  Interim earnings for that quarter were prorat-
ed at an 11 week/13 week ratio.

53 The  backpay  period  was  tolled  for  the  entire  fourth  quarter  of 
2011.  Respondent did not receive an offset for the $7,760 in interim 
earnings that Membrino received that quarter.

54 I deducted 43 days (8.6 weeks) from the first quarter of 2012 be-
cause the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from January 1 to 
March 1, 2012.  Interim earnings for that quarter were prorated at a 4.4 
week/13 week ratio.

55 I deducted 14 days (2.8 weeks) from the fourth quarter of 2012 
because the backpay period was tolled in that quarter from December 
12–31, 2012.  Interim earnings for that quarter were prorated at a 10.2 
week/13 week ratio.

56 After  tolling  the  backpay  period  from  January  1–30,  2013, 
Membrino worked 8 days (1.6 weeks) before the backpay period ended 
on February 8, 2013.  Interim earnings were prorated at an 8.2 week/13 
week ratio (Membrino worked 8.2 weeks in the first quarter of 2013, 
not counting the period that backpay was tolled).

57 Neither the Board’s enforced order nor the compliance specifica-
tion includes a remedy for the adverse consequences of the multiyear 
lump  sum  backpay  award  to  Membrino.    See  Latino  Express,  359 
NLRB No. 44 (2012), which issued after the Board’s order in this case.  
Accordingly,  I have not included such a remedy in the recommended 
supplemental  order.    See  Life’s  Connections, 359  NLRB  No.  85,  slip 
op. at 2 fn. 5 (2013).
